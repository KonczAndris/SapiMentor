"Iuhos Imola","OpenGL application for smartphone","Abstract
The topic of my thesis is to create a smartphone application based on OpenGL.
OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a partially developed standard that covers an
API that makes it possible to manage the graphics card and program two- and three-
dimensional graphics through a simple, standard interface. OpenGL is a tool that pro-
grammers enjoy using because it allows almost direct control of the graphics card, three-
dimensional shapes can be easily drawn, and the rendering method can be controlled.
In today’s world, people are increasingly visual, their attention is drawn to what
pleases the eye, what is interesting, exciting, new, modern. We all want to gather new
experiences, enrich ourselves with new experiences and use modern technology.
That’s exactly why I chose OpenGL, because I wanted to implement an application
that would give children a fun opportunity to assess their knowledge of the Bible. In
addition to deepening knowledge, an important goal was to provide children with a play
experience. Since children are very visual, we have found virtual reality to be the most
ideal way to capture the interest of 7-12 year olds and deepen and expand their Bible
knowledge.
OpenGL gave me a simple, nice and quickly implementable help to achieve my goal.
In this dissertation, I will briefly introduce the Unity programming platform, the
Google Cardboard virtual reality program, and the application I created.","","OpenGL, Smartphone application, Graphics card, Three-dimensional graphics, Virtual reality, ","2023"
"Hegyi Benjamin","Using the Monte Carlo algorithm in the game Battleship","Abstract
The Monte Carlo algorithm is a popular computational technique used in many fields
such as physics, finance and computer science. One of the prominent applications of the
Monte Carlo algorithm is in game-playing artificial intelligence. Monte Carlo algorithms
are useful in AI games because they can simulate and evaluate different moves, allowing
the AI to select the best move based on the results of the simulation. In this paper, we
investigate the use of the Monte Carlo algorithm in the game Battleship and its strengths
and weaknesses.","Monte Carlo algorithm, Minimax algorithm, Alpha-Beta pruning, MonteCarlo Tree Search","Monte Carlo algorithm, Game playing artificial intelligence, Battleship, Simulation, AI games, ","2023"
"Koncz Krisztian","Musical hide and seek","Abstract
Summary The theme of my bachelor’s thesis is the development of a web application
which helps getting to know old and new acquaintances through their musical taste.
The musical taste of a person reveals a lot about their personality. Furthermore, if
we know somebody’s musical taste it is easier to start a conversation which is useful in
the early stages of a friendship.
Such an application, together with get to know you games, is a very good icebreaker,
because it can be funny to get to know somebody through music. In addition, we can get
acquainted with musical genres or songs previously unknown to us.
The online interface enables us to play even when we are not in the same location.
We can get closer to our colleagues during online classes or online work","","Web application, Musical taste, Personality, Icebreaker, Online interface, ","2023"
"Bodor Benjamin","The magic of logic: steps to make puzzle games","Abstract
Elements that contribute to the user experience and motivation of games include puzzle
games, animations, visualizations, interactions and character design itself. These important
componentsnotonlymakethegameaestheticallyappealing,butalsoensureactiveparticipation
and enjoyment for the player.
Puzzle games are exciting challenges that require creative thinking and problem-solving
skills to solve. The varied tasks encourage the player to take logical steps, combining and
matching different elements or objects to reach a solution.
Animationsandvisualizationsadddynamismandlivelinesstothegame.Thesemovements,
transitions and spectacular effects make the game world more realistic and immersive, capturing
the player’s attention. Animations help to keep the characters and their environment in motion,
adding to the interactivity and enjoyment of the game.
Interaction is one of the most important elements of the game experience, as it allows
the player to actively participate in the game world. The player’s actions and choices affect
the gameplay and story. Interaction gives the player the opportunity to control the character,
manipulate the environment and explore the possibilities of the game.
The pixel art style gives the game a unique and easily recognizable visual identity. The
appearance and attributes of characters influence the emotional connection and identification
of players with them, and the pixel art style provides a unique aesthetic experience that evokes
the atmosphere of retro games and brings back memories of the past.
These elements combine to make the game enjoyable and motivating. Interaction, inter-
esting puzzle games, animations, visualizations and good character design play a key role in
enhancing the user experience and motivating players. It is important to emphasize that the
lack of these elements, which are closely linked to the interactivity and interest of the games,
can reduce the attractiveness of the game and do not motivate the user to continue playing.","puzzle games, animation, visualization, interaction, character design, pixelart","Puzzle games, Animations, Visualizations, Interactions, Character design, ","2023"

The topic of my thesis is a mobile application that connects mentors and a mentees.
Nowadays,wewanttoreacheverythingeasilyandquicklybothinourprivatelifeand
at work, and smartphones also contribute to this, as they greatly facilitate our everyday
tasks. But in a new environment or place, in order to be able to carry out the work
smoothly, it is good if someone shows us what we actually have to do. We can perform
more effectively if we have concrete goals and their corresponding specifications and
priorities.
There are two types of users in the project, mentor and mentee, who are connected
in an Android mobile application. The application allows mentors to create tasks for a
user after logging in. In addition, mentors have the option to add new members to the
group.
And the mentees are informed about the activities related to them after logging into
the application. Just like the mentors, to mentees also have the opportunity to modify
and view the tasks. The goal of the project is not for the mentor to be able to monitor
the mentee, but only guidance is the main guiding principle.
The developed application enables users to display and modify their own personal

several disadvantages. These problems include high storage usage and teaching costs.
In my thesis, I present the use of genetic algorithms in pattern recognition. I present
the concept of the genetic algorithm and give an example of how it works. Then I present
the genetic algorithm I use, which I built around attribute chains in order to create a
pattern recognition program.
In my thesis, I compare a polygon in an input image with a certain predefined set
of polygons and examine which polygon is included in the input polygon. I perform the
search with a genetic algorithm, so that I examine a fitness value over several generations,
and then the member with the best value becomes the solution. I get the members in
each generation by crossing and mutating the members of the previous generation and
by using elitism on the previous generation.","","Pattern Recognition, Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, Agriculture, Fitness Value, ","2023"

"Siko Mark Levente","MuresTracker - City issue tracker","Abstract
The topic of my paper is MuresTracker, a software that enables city residents to
report issues and facilitates efficient management of these problems by city authorities.
City administrations face numerous challenges on a daily basis that impact the quality
of life for residents. Potholes, malfunctioning streetlights, crime, safety concerns, and
similar issues are present in the daily lives of residents, and their dissatisfaction is not
always expressed in the most appropriate places. Therefore, cities require effective tools
for tracking and addressing problems.
MuresTracker addresses this problem by providing a platform for residents to report
issues and track their status, while also enabling city officials to confront and resolve
these problems. The website serves as a valuable tool for improving communication,
increasing civic engagement, monitoring and managing problems, and promoting more
efficient urban services. It offers a wide range of user-friendly reporting and tracking
capabilities and can have a positive impact on residents’ lives and the efficiency of cities.
The application allows registered regular users to add and view problems reported
by others in the city, including details, location, and who and when they were resolved.
Users with administrator roles are responsible for directing problems of a certain category
to the appropriate department. Additionally, they have insight into user information and
can modify or deactivate users in case of inappropriate behavior.","city, issues, web application, spring boot.","MuresTracker, City residents, Issues reporting, City management, Urban services, ","2023"
"Balazs Endre","The interactive adventures of UnitTiby: The role of algorithmic games in education","Abstract
The topic of my paper is the role of algorithmic games in education. Nowadays, stu-
dents are growing up alongside digital technologies, using smartphones, playing computer
games, and actively participating in the online world. Compared to previous decades,
forms of entertainment have undergone significant changes, greatly influencing modern
education. Teachers need to employ new methods and techniques to sustain interest and
stimulate further learning. Gamification, or the use of game elements, is a very impor-
tant component of modern education and can provide an effective solution to changing
teaching needs.
I conducted a research study among students in Transylvania, where I gathered their
opinions on the usefulness of various game elements in relation to learning. These game
elements are all associated with gamification.
Based on my own experiences, educational games can greatly assist the learning
process. Their greatest advantage is that they allow learning useful things in a highly en-
joyable and playful manner. My goal was to create an educational game that incorporates
the game elements found to be advantageous in my research.
The purpose of the game I developed is to help users grasp the basics of the C pro-
gramming language. The protagonist of the game is a university student named UniTiby,

"Fodor Lehel","Visualization of geometric equilibrium points","Abstract
In a two-person game the purpose of both players is obviously to win the game by
following the game’s rules and regulations. Therefore, both of the players resorts to the
strategy that results their the gratest benefit. However, there are games, when if one of
the players applies their strategy, it also benefits the other, which is obviously unfavorable
for the first mentioned player. For this reason, both players must determine the relative
frequency of using their available strategies to maximize their chances for the victory.
This problem is answered by the Nash equilibrium point, named after the American
mathematician, John Forbes Nash. In two-person games, that set of strategy in which
neither of the players can increase their profit by changing their strategy, in case of their
opponent doesn’t change their strategy, is called Nash equilibrium point.
In my thesis the main purpose is to determine the equilibrium point mentioned
above, mathematically and also in programming point of view, using the prisoner’s
dilemma problem. Besides that I will cover the following topics as well: the introduction
of basic concepts of game theory, the prisoner’s dilemma, the presentation of applied
algorithm and the interpretation of the result. To compute this equilibrium point I apply
the Lemke-Howson algorithm. For the visualization of obtained equilibrium point I use
Python as programming language.
Also belong to the goals to introduce the reader to the world of game theory and
to help users with average mathematical and information technology skill to understand
the Nash equilibrium.","two-person game, strategy, John Forbes Nash, Nash equilibrium point,Lemke-Howson algorithm, visualization.","Nash equilibrium, Game theory, Strategy, Prisoner's dilemma, Algorithm, ","2023"
"Pallfy Roland","Decentralized messaging and data sharing","Abstract
Decentralized messaging and data sharing have emerged as promising approaches to
address the challenges and limitations of centralized systems in the digital era. This paper
explores the concept of decentralization in the context of messaging and data sharing,
highlighting its advantages and potential implications.
The traditional approach to messaging and data sharing relies heavily on centralized
platforms, where users’ information is stored and controlled by a single entity. However,
this centralized model has inherent limitations, including privacy concerns, data breaches,
censorship, and dependency on a single point of failure. These issues have led to growing
interest in decentralized alternatives.
Decentralized messaging systems utilize peer-to-peer networks and distributed pro-
tocols to enable direct communication between users, eliminating the need for intermedi-
aries. This approach ensures greater privacy, as users have more control over their data
and can communicate directly without relying on a central server. Additionally, decen-
tralized messaging systems can resist censorship attempts, as there is no central authority
to regulate or control the flow of information.
Similarly, decentralized data sharing aims to democratize the access and control of
data. By leveraging blockchain technology and distributed storage systems, users can se-
curely share and store data without relying on centralized entities. This enables greater
transparency, data integrity, and resilience against attacks or data loss. Moreover, de-
centralized data sharing incentivizes collaboration and innovation, as participants can
contribute and access data in a trustless and permissionless environment.
While decentralized messaging and data sharing offer numerous benefits, they also
present challenges. The scalability of decentralized systems, the verification of data au-
thenticity, and the incentivization of participants are among the key areas that require
further research and development. Additionally, legal and regulatory frameworks need to
adapt to accommodate the decentralized nature of these systems, ensuring both privacy
protection and accountability.
The aim of this thesis is to present an application based on a decentralised system
and to introduce the reader to the technologies needed to build it.","","Decentralization, Messaging, Data sharing, Blockchain technology, Privacy concerns, ","2023"

With the rapid advancement of technology, numerous new possibilities have opened
up before us, fundamentally transforming our everyday lives. These changes have not
only affected communication and work but have also had an impact on entertainment
and learning.
Video games offer interactive entertainment, immersing their users in a world created
by another person. We can interact with events that we couldn’t even imagine a hundred
years ago because they seemed unrealistic to us. However, modern game development
technologies allow us to experience these in a virtual environment.
We are capable of simulating battles, constructing cities, piloting spaceships any-
where in the galaxy, or even observing the explosion of a planet. Movies or even entire
books can be adapted so that we can live through their stories interactively. The only
limit is human imagination.
Video games have not only created an entirely new and infinite world of enter-
tainment but also enable us to gamify education within the framework of schools and
universities. In every field, from finance to programming, we can find at least one game
aimed at the user’s development.

Today, the number of private entrepreneurs and businesses is growing. The idea of
running a business has become more normalised, it no longer seems that only someone of
the calibre of Steve Jobs or Bill Gates can run a company, so more and more young people
are trying and more new businesses are being born. However, the optimal functioning of
a modern business requires the right tools to help monitor certain behaviours, create
a successful client-provider communication interface, help manage the resources of the
business, or even shorten the time taken up by paperwork.
The aim of my thesis is to find a simple, fast and attractive solution for the latter of
these, more specifically for the generation and storage of tax invoices. The application I
have created aims to be a guaranteed solution for businesses and entrepreneurs that sell
services or products and need to generate invoice statements.
The application can be made highly accessible thanks to its web-based format. I have
created an easy-to-use schema for editing and saving invoices. The application also leaves
room for users who do not wish to log in, but for users with an account, it provides an
archive that helps not only to visualise the already created invoices, but also to highlight
them statistically.

Online shopping is thriving in today’s world. Customers strive to choose convenient
solutions for furnishing their homes, and the first step is purchasing furniture. In recent
years, online shopping has gained a significant advantage over in-person shopping with
physical contact. To achieve this, there are numerous options available to interested indi-
viduals, ranging from online stores published on websites to ordering via phone calls and
specifically developed mobile applications.
Taking these aspects into account, I have chosen a theme for my project that aligns
with current trends while also incorporating innovative technologies to enhance the user
experience. My project implements an online furniture store within an Android applica-
tion. The app provides a convenient and user-friendly interface for both the seller, who
fulfills the role of an administrator, and the buyer, who acts as a user.
From a design perspective, the user interface is clean, easily understandable, and
manageable for everyone, while also offering all the necessary functions for a seamless
shopping experience. Users can create their own accounts, allowing them to browse the
application at their leisure, favorite products for future reference, and complete the pur-
chase process.
Perhaps the only drawback of online shopping is the difficulty in physically observing
the products due to the absence of physical presence. While physical shopping allows us
to use all our senses to select and examine items from every angle, touch them, and rotate
them, online shops generally do not offer solutions to these issues.
In my project, I have endeavored to overcome this drawback by implementing a
virtual room feature that allows buyers to not only view images and read descriptions of
desired products but also observe them in 3D, rotate them, and place them proportionally
within a room. This functionality enhances the shopping experience and reduces the risk
of returns by offering customers the opportunity for more thorough observation.","","Online shopping, Furniture, User experience, Mobile application, Virtual room, ","2023"
"Nyitrai Orsolya Eva","Automated baccalaureate exam result gatherer and visualizer system","Abstract
My thesis topic is implementing an automated system that aims to collect, clean,
and visualize the baccalaureate exam results of Romanian students for the end users.
The baccalaureate exam results are of paramount importance not only for students
and teachers but also for educational institutions alike. These data greatly influence
the future possibilities of students, whether it’s about career opportunities or further
education, and they also reflect the quality of education in schools. Visualizing these
results provides an opportunity for effective evaluation of education since parents and
teachers can gain a comprehensive understanding of students’ knowledge and progress
based on the data. This can help improve the learning process and the development of
teaching programs.
In my thesis, I aimed to provide a user-friendly interface to the target audience,
which can efficiently and quickly process the given data set. I felt the need to develop
such a system because the current options for reviewing the data are limited, mostly
relying on time-consuming and manual processes, which often lead to errors or delays.
Additionally, I paid special attention to the quality of the data to ensure its consistency
and normalization for future use.
The user interface was implemented using the Next.js framework, with the assistance
of D3 and the related Recharts data visualization tools for creating visualizations.
The server-side application was built with the Nest.js framework, utilizing the Type-
Script language, and it is responsible for managing and serving the data.
The foundation of the architecture consists of the scraper and cleaning systems. The
web scraper was developed in GoLang, which is suitable for the efficient handling and
processing of large data sets. For data cleaning and pre-processing, I used the Python
language, specifically the Pandas library, which is a popular data manipulation tool. Ad-
ditionally, I worked with various other libraries and technologies, which will be discussed
in more detail later on.
The main goal in selecting the aforementioned technologies was not only to enable
easy and fast access to the data, more accurate inference drawing, and better understand-
ing of the result for everyone but also to ensure that the system is future-proof and allows
further development.","","Automated system, Baccalaureate exam results, Data visualization, Educational institutions, User interface, ","2023"

ments, but used the real email communication database of the ENRON company. In
the research, I also conducted data mining to exclusively examine internal relationships
within the company, thereby reducing the number of nodes used in the graph.
During my interdisciplinary research, I utilized various graph-theoretical algorithms
such as depth-first search and the Girvan-Newman method.
The real database provides the opportunity to examine the dynamics of the network,
allowing us to track the formation of connections, which can be visualized as well.","","Social phenomena, Email communication network, Algorithms, Graph theory, Data mining, ","2023"

their time more efficiently and plan their daily life better. The app helps them anticipate
and manage events so they don’t miss important appointments or commitments. It also
helps you avoid chaos caused by unexpected events, because by managing your time,
there will be fewer surprises and less stress. SmartCalendar not only helps you manage
your time, it also manages your appointments as a service provider. It allows businesses to
easily and automatically notify their customers of scheduled services. This means signifi-
cant ease and efficiency for service providers, as clients receive timely notifications so they
don’t forget or miss appointments. The app is designed to provide access to scheduling
and customer notification functionality for any business, regardless of size or form. This
means that even small service providers who could not previously afford to develop such
an application can use it. SmartCalendar therefore provides an opportunity to ensure
that customers are informed in a timely manner and do not forget scheduled services.
The paper describes in detail how the application works and how it provides customer
notification. It also shows how the application can make this functionality available to
users free of charge. SmartCalendar opens up new opportunities for more efficient time

"Burszan Hunor","Exploring Distribution Forecasting with Amazon Forecast","Abstract
Demand forecasting is an extremely important and valuable activity in many in-
dustries and business environments. Accurate forecasting allows companies to effectively
manage inventory, optimise their design and manufacturing processes, develop sales and
marketing strategies, reduce costs and increase efficiency. One of the main benefits of
demand forecasting is the ability to manage inventory efficiently, as it allows companies
to minimise stock shortages and overstocks, optimise stock levels and reduce storage and
warehousing costs. Demand forecasting also helps to optimise design and production pro-
cesses. Forecasting allows companies to plan their production capacity, adjust production
schedules and make more efficient use of available resources. It also enables companies
to better understand their customers’ needs and behaviour. This allows the development
of personalised product offerings, the optimisation of sales and marketing strategies and
the delivery of a better customer experience. It helps companies to improve customer
satisfaction and loyalty by enabling companies to accurately reach and meet customer
needs based on predictions.
Effective inventory management is partly based on good demand forecasting. Not
only does insufficient inventory cause customer dissatisfaction and loss of revenue, but
if it happens often enough, or at an important enough time for a customer, it can also
result in the loss of future business. However, oversupply is costly in terms of storage and
logistics, and some stock can remain unsold for a long time - or even forever - resulting in
a total loss of investment. Finding the right stock balance is therefore an essential aspect
of good demand forecasting.
Over the years, there have been significant developments in the field of demand
forecasting.Thecontinuousdevelopmentofforecastingmethodsandtechniques,aswellas
the increase in the quantity and quality of data available, has had a significant impact on
theaccuracyandreliabilityofforecasting.Inaddition,improvementsindatamanagement
and processing have also led to significant progress. Developments in data mining and
machine learning algorithms allow the analysis of complex data sets and the identification
of hidden patterns, thus helping to produce more accurate and reliable forecasts.
The aim of this paper is to predict the future demand distribution of some prod-
ucts by demonstrating the process of creating a time series forecast using the Amazon
Forecast web service, which does not require prior knowledge of machine learning and
artificial intelligence. The paper presents the complete process required to produce the
forecasts, including the associated logic, and the desktop application designed to manage
the Forecast by communicating with the service. The results of the forecasts are displayed

"Gabos Alpar","EduLane: Course Guide in Your Pocket","Abstract
The topic of my thesis is to simplify learning through online courses using software.
Withthehelpofmoderntechnologiesusedtoday,almostanythingcanbelearnedthrough
online courses. This form of online learning is becoming increasingly popular, resulting
in a growing number of such courses available on the market, which makes it increasingly
difficult to choose the ones that are truly relevant for us.
Online courses are available from an increasing number of providers. However, in
order to find the ideal one for us, we have to explore multiple learning platforms, which
can be a time-consuming task. In this case, it is important to be able to find the most
suitable course from as many sources as possible in the shortest possible time, particularly
on a specific topic.
In my thesis, I aim to present a software that can facilitate this course search process.
The main purpose of developing the software is to allow individuals who want to learn
to see the courses in one place, combining various courses from the mentioned learning
platforms. Additionally, it is important that the software’s users are able to save these
courses and track their progress.
During the design and development process, I have also taken into account the ex-
periences of other similar applications in order to provide new and innovative features to
users. The thesis will provide a detailed presentation of the application’s structure, the
technologies used, and the access and processing of the courses.
Finally, the completed software will be presented, demonstrating in practice how

"Magyari Dora","Personalized content recommandation","Abstract
I chose the personalized content recommendation system of websites as the topic of
mythesis,becauseuserexperienceanduniquecontentareessentialforsuccessfulwebsites.
A personalized content recommendation system allows users to access content that is a
relevant to their interests. This can increase time spent on this site, improve return rates
and build a deeper relationship with the site.
The benefits of personalized content recommendation include a unique user expe-
rience, increased relevance of content and increased user satisfaction. The system takes
into account users browsing history and habits, using different algorithms to provide them
with more accurate recommendations. This makes it easier for users to find content that
matches their interests and discover new things.
My thesis presents a website with images by category. I have chosen to do this
because I find the role of images on this type of website extremely important in attracting
attention. Images are attractive and quickly attract the attention of users. Therefore, a
content recommendation system full of images is an excellent opportunity to capture the
interest of users in an entertaining way.
My content recommendation is implemented by measuring the time spent on images.
measuring time spent on images can help to increase the effectiveness of content recom-
mendation. If users spend more time looking at or exploring images, it may indicate that
the content is interesting or attractive to them. This information allows the system to
draw conclusions about users preferences and tastes. For example, if someone looks at
sports photos for a longer period of time, it may indicate that they are interested in this
type of content. Based on this, the system can recommend further similar content, which
is more likely to attract teh interest.","","Personalized content recommendation, User experience, Unique content, Browsing history, Images, ","2023"

"Major Zsolt","Create and import basketball league and statistical survey data into .Net Maui","Abstract
In the realm of competitive sports, it is not uncommon for individuals who follow
a contest from the sidelines to immerse themselves in the world of competition to such
a degree, that they passionately cheer for a favorite side or even place bets on certain
competitors. The competitive curiosity of humans can manifest in various ways, ranging
from the frenzy of cheering alongside numerous other fans at a live match to everyday
conversations with friends at a bar on who will win today’s big game. Building upon this
idea, I have developed a computer application that offers two important possibilities for
users to solve dilemmas that arise in the realm of basketball championships: a system
for importing and recording team and player performances, which enables us to create
complex and advanced insights not only into an athlete’s personal statistics, but also to
compare them with those of another party, and a championship creation program where
we can form teams led by others, engage in matches with them, and maintain rankings
based on those matches.
To implement this system, I have developed a .Net MAUI program based on the C#
language. It utilizes a MySQL-based phpMyAdmin database system to store and retrieve
data for teams, players, and their statistics. Additionally, through an API, there is a
possibility to fetch statistics of real NBA players and teams for different seasons, which
will be used to create multi-layered metric measurements.
My application can be divided into three distinctive menu sections. The first one is
the league creator, where users can employ personally created clubs in various matches.
Within this section, they can assign statistics and final results to players associated
with the teams, and also rank the teams and players based on different criterias. The
second section is the team and player creator, where users can create teams, customize
them, and also retrieve and store the seasonal performances of real teams and players
in the database. The third section, which is also a crucial one, is the comparation and
evaluation section, where imported teams and players can be evaluated and compared
using different convoluted metrics and graphs based on the imported information based
on their performance.","basketball, personalized championship, match maintenance, compar-isons, statistics, metrics, competitional curiosity, datamining","Competitive sports, Computer application, Basketball championships, .Net MAUI program, MySQL database, ","2023"

"Jakab Etele","Stock price prediction and visualization","Abstract
One of the most studied sectors of economics and financial analysis is stock trading,
where participants buy and sell shares on the stock exchange or other financial markets.
It can be said that this is the most dynamic area for investors in capitalist countries,
which has numerous advantages but also carries several critical risks.
The biggest advantage of this industry is that investors can quickly gain substantial
profits from the rise of stock prices or periodic dividend payments. However, due to price
volatility, one must also consider the possibility of losses resulting from sudden drops in
stock prices. Investors need proper knowledge and experience to trade successfully and
minimize risks.
The fluctuation of stock prices depends on various factors such as the economic
environment, political situation, market trends, and corporate performance. Examining
and analyzing these factors is a highly complex process, given that stock price changes
are triggered by intricate impulses rooted in high levels of abstraction.
The thesis consists of two main chapters. The first chapter focuses on a desktop ap-
plication built with Python and Tkinter, presenting its structure, operational principles,
and already implemented functionalities. The second chapter introduces two indepen-
dently developed and separate prediction systems, as well as a third approach resulting
from their combination. The first system is based on deep learning neural networks, while
the second operates using classification algorithms in the approach of news analysis.
The aim during the development of the desktop application was to enable it to work
with data from nearly a hundred publicly traded companies, automatically update them,
process them using multiple analytical methods, and present the results to the user using
visualization tools. From a program design perspective, I followed the modern principle
of allowing for easy expansion and post-development modifications of the application.
The research section aimed to develop a method capable of providing highly accurate
predictions regarding market changes based on past market data and news feeds. These
methods were tested, results were documented, compared with each other, and essential
conclusions were drawn.
The social goal of the research is to facilitate safer stock market investments and
protect people’s savings, particularly during a period when economic prospects are rather
turbulent. In 2022, the average annual inflation in the European Union was 10.4%, in
Hungary 24.5%, in Romania 14.1%, while in the Eurozone it reached 9.2%. In contrast,
the average annual deposit interest rates in Hungary were 6.1%, and in Romania, they
reached 7.2%.","","Stock trading, Investment risks, Economic factors, Prediction systems, Financial markets, ","2023"
"Veres Napsugar Anna","SimultanQ - the Design and Development of an Interactive Quiz Game","Abstract
The topic of my thesis is to implement an interactive quiz game without restricting
the number of participating players using a web application.
Quiz games are extremely popular nowadays and offer numerous advantages. People
enjoy challenges, especially when presented in a playful form. Live quiz games provide an
exciting and interactive experience as they allow players to compete with each other and
test their knowledge. The multiplayer mode facilitates all of this.
The fact that players participate simultaneously in the quiz game and there is the
possibility of real-time tracking of results makes the game even more thrilling and can
have a community-building impact.
The name of my application is ""SimultanQ,"" which aims to represent this concept.
""Simultan"" refers to shared, simultaneous activities, while the suffix ""Q"" stands for ""Quiz.""
Analyzing existing online and freely accessible similar applications reveals that the
number of participants is limited during the game. Within the scope of this project, a
web application has been developed without such restrictions. Users can easily register,
create quizzes after logging in, and start the game in a straightforward manner. They
can enable players to join the quiz by sharing a PIN code, and the players can access the
questions based on this information.
The application contributes to the realization of beloved challenges, the implemen-

and artificial intelligence.
The clear presentation of dynamic programming is extremely important for students.
Imagine inviting them on an exciting adventure into the world of problem-solving. Show
them how they can break down complex tasks into simpler subproblems, and by solving
these, they can eventually reach the complete solution. Enrich the lesson with examples

representing the same board game for millions of people. It doesn’t have any hidden parts
or any elements of chance, everything stands in front of the two players from the very
beginning to until the checkmate.
In spite of all these, one of the biggest change brought to chess were the programs
and algorithms made by computer scientist from the past decades. These offered a deeper
insight into the world of chess, calculating the best steps from any given position, from an
unfathomable number of choices. As these programs evolved, the game received a whole
new dimension of depth, since we could analyze every single detail, the most optimal
strategy could be generated in mere seconds.
With my thesis, I would like to expand the ranks of these programs, looking to
solve chess problems and puzzles, which even thousands of years ago could have occupied
people.
My algorithms show step-by-step how they find solutions for the given cases, with
added explanations. My goal, in addition to chess’ complexity, is to clarify these algo-
rithms for anyone, with an interactive interface.
My chess algorithms look for solutions to these problems in several ways, in a given
example they choose the best steps by analyzing the current situation or they get a
solution by testing all the possible cases. By saving the running times, I tried to present
the chess problems in easily understandable and visually pleasing way with the help of

"Bakó László Mihály","Open doors with human-machine interface: a new approach to password-free secure access","Abstract
In this thesis, we have explored the possibility of using human-machine interfaces
as a new approach to password-free secure access and user authentication. In the pro-
posed approach, the active interface, which monitors some biometric process, serves as
a non-transferable authentication token based on a secure “dead man switch”. If the
connection is terminated, the system automatically revokes the privileges and logs the
user out. To avoid forgery and impersonation, the system uses a one-time key protected
communication protocol between the clients and the server managing access to resources.
In this research, we analyzed possible solutions based on the criteria of security,
convenience and cost-effectiveness, and implemented a system based on a comfortable
wearable visual cortex activity monitor and a low-cost heart rate monitoring system. The
completed systems were tested to assess their reliability and safety.
The results of the research show that the combination of non-transferable authenti-
cation tokens, biometrics and communication protocol offers a promising alternative to
password or simple token-based access control systems, as it improves security and allows
for more flexible security roles, such as temporary authorised security roles.","","Human machine interfaces, Authentication, Biometrics, Communication protocol, Security, ","2023"
"Derzsi Daniel","Contract Creation and Property Sales Through the Web","Abstract
In today’s fast-paced world, individuals and businesses engaged in real estate trans-
actions often encounter significant challenges when drafting property sale contracts. The
creation of these property sale contracts is an integral part of real estate transactions, in-
volving complex legalities and meticulous documentation. There is a pressing need for an
intuitive tool that can alleviate these complexities and facilitate the creation of accurate
and legally compliant contracts.
The aim of my thesis is two-fold. Firstly, I intend to create the basis of an online
platform to allow the automatic creation of contracts to facilitate secure property sales.
This includes the creation and planification of the necessary software architecture, the
creation of an easy to use administration interface, as well as the verbatim generation
and filling out of PDF documents using templates created by the administrators. Sec-
ondly, I intend to document the various stages (and possibilities) of the final deployment,
measured within real-world conditions.
The proposed website serves as a comprehensive platform, offering users a friendly
interface to generate legally binding contracts tailored to their specific requirements. By
eliminating the need for extensive legal knowledge or the assistance of costly attorneys,
the time and effort required to create a contract is greatly reduced.
Comparatively, governments worldwide have implemented similar software solu-
tions to address the challenges associated with property sale contracts. However, these
government-backed endeavours are often significantly handicapped by their perceived ob-
scurity and their convoluted design choices. This platform aims to provide users with a
unique and simplified experience that surpasses existing government initiatives.
In the beginning of the thesis we will discuss the various technologies employed to
create the proposed software solution. Afterwards, we will describe what the software
will do and how it will be expected to perform as part of a Software Requirements
Specification. A prospective user interface for the platform will be detailed following
the proposal of a potential software architecture and deployment layout. Finally, some
measurements will be presented to rationalize the decisions taken during the planning
stages of the software architecture.","Property contracts, Document templates, PDF document generation,Docker deployment, Serverless technologies.","Real estate transactions, Property sale contracts, Online platform, Software architecture, Legally compliant, ","2023"
"Csegzi Hunor","System to collect and elaborate data in superior education","Abstract
In my dissertation, I developed a system to collect and elaborate data in superior
education to ensure quality. I started to develop a web application, in which it is possible
to create statements, modify tables containing data, delete, overwrite data, and upload
them in Excel format. The software helps anyone who has access to it, enter data, and
organize transparent data sets from displayed tables.
Priortothedevelopment,Iconsideredseveralalternativesolutions,butinconclusion,
the technology I chose proved to be the most effective. This technology is the RDLC
report, which was initially unknown to me as well, thus I learned and discovered it both
during the development process of my dissertation and during the writing process. The
most important of the many advantages of this solution is the easy editing, which can be
dynamically edited and implemented in XML format, but last but not least it is easier
to implement with the system packages I have chosen.
The development of the system was guided by opinions who has to elaborate data
to create reports. The elaboration of data has been, and will continue to be necessary, so
I kept it important throughout my software development to keep the project sustainable
and functional in the long run with minimal development. I created the system with the
information obtained during the research and taking into account the needs and requests
of the target user, as the most important thing is that the user community accepts it and
is happy to use it. This solid, analytical platform also simplifies the day-to-day tasks of
teachers involved in education, but provides a simple, clean, usable interface during the
years.
With the simplicity and efficiency in mind, I have written my dissertation, the main
functionality of which is the elaboration of reports, embedded in a user interface that
meets the current design conditions, where the competent user can understand the soft-
ware and easily find the desired information to access this function. Thus, the system and
website I have designed and implemented provides a user-friendly environment for both
clients and the designer.","RDLC, elaboration, web","system development, web application, data organization, RDLC report, user-friendly interface.","2023"
"Molnar Krisztian","Visualizations of large collections of images","Abstract
Currently, we have access to large image collections both personally and in research.
Visualizing these collections can contribute to the discovery of latent patterns.
The topic of my thesis is the display and visualization of large image collections in
various layouts. The size of the image collections I used exceeds forty thousand images,
but the theoretical upper limit surpasses this by far.
I have developed an application that can display the images from the opened collec-
tion and arrange them based on extracted metadata, all within seconds.
My application is built on a client-server architecture. The server is written in the
Rust[rus23] programming language using the Axum framework. The client, running in the
browser, is built in TypeScript[typ23] and consists of two main parts. The desired layout
can be selected through a user interface created with the React[rea23] framework, and
this code is also responsible for the settings of the selected layout. The part responsible
for image display does not use a framework but follows a custom-designed architecture.
The WebGL[web23] library is used for rendering the images.
The application has gone through several development cycles. I will now present the
design decisions necessary for displaying image collections of this size and support them
with measurements.
Furthermore, I will showcase the layouts generated by the application for the collec-
tion I used.","images, display, collections, layouts, clustering","Large image collections, Visualization, Display, Layouts, Metadata, ","2023"
"Kolumban Attila","Rubik’s cube solver for phones","Abstract
The Rubik’s Cube is one of the worlds most iconic and most interesting puzzle
game. The first Rubik’s Cube was made in the year 1974 by Rubik Ernő, who was a
Hungarian architect, sculptor and game designer. Since its inception, it became popular
worldwide, it entertains millions of people every day. Solving the Rubik’s Cube demands
attention, patients and strategic thinking of its user, but thanks to improvements of
modern technology, the way of thinking needed to solve the cube is a lot easier to learn.
Thanks to the improvements of our smart devices and automated robots, solving
the Rubik’s Cube reached new levels. These days Rubik’s Cube solver application are
available on personal computers, and also on smart phones, making the learning of new
solving algorithms a lot easier. Usually an application like this show a 3D representation
of a Rubik’s Cube on the screen of the device, which can be rotated by the user using
fingers or a mouse. The applications then calculate an optimal solution, and shows it to
the user. The user can copy these steps on his own cube, this way he can devolop his own
skills. Usually its a plus, if the application is not only able to show an optimal solution,
but also can show given solving algorithms, this way helping the user understand the
cube more.
My software is able to read in a real cube, using the camera of a smart device, this
way speeding up the process of inputting the state of the cube into the application. After
the scanning of the cube is done, the user can ask for an optimal solution, of which he
can go through step by step, or if he feels like it, he can try to solve the cube himself.
Aside from this, i wanted to implement a feature, where the user can learn given solving
algorithms. For this reason exists a separate menu, where the user can choose a solving
algorithm, and can see its steps on the cube.
The application was made in Unity, using C#, and for finding an optimal solution
i used Kociemba’s two step solving algorithm. This algorithm is well liked for its speed
and low solution step count.","","Rubik's Cube, Solver application, Technology improvements, Smart devices, Solving algorithms, ","2023"
