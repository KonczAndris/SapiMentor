Iuhos Imola,OpenGL application for smartphone,"Abstract
The topic of my thesis is to create a smartphone application based on OpenGL.
OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a partially developed standard that covers an
API that makes it possible to manage the graphics card and program two- and three-
dimensional graphics through a simple, standard interface. OpenGL is a tool that pro-
grammers enjoy using because it allows almost direct control of the graphics card, three-
dimensional shapes can be easily drawn, and the rendering method can be controlled.
In today’s world, people are increasingly visual, their attention is drawn to what
pleases the eye, what is interesting, exciting, new, modern. We all want to gather new
experiences, enrich ourselves with new experiences and use modern technology.
That’s exactly why I chose OpenGL, because I wanted to implement an application
that would give children a fun opportunity to assess their knowledge of the Bible. In
addition to deepening knowledge, an important goal was to provide children with a play
experience. Since children are very visual, we have found virtual reality to be the most
ideal way to capture the interest of 7-12 year olds and deepen and expand their Bible
knowledge.
OpenGL gave me a simple, nice and quickly implementable help to achieve my goal.
In this dissertation, I will briefly introduce the Unity programming platform, the
Google Cardboard virtual reality program, and the application I created.",,"OpenGL, Smartphone application, Graphics card, Three-dimensional graphics, Virtual reality, ",2023
Hegyi Benjamin,Using the Monte Carlo algorithm in the game Battleship,"Abstract
The Monte Carlo algorithm is a popular computational technique used in many fields
such as physics, finance and computer science. One of the prominent applications of the
Monte Carlo algorithm is in game-playing artificial intelligence. Monte Carlo algorithms
are useful in AI games because they can simulate and evaluate different moves, allowing
the AI to select the best move based on the results of the simulation. In this paper, we
investigate the use of the Monte Carlo algorithm in the game Battleship and its strengths
and weaknesses.","Monte Carlo algorithm, Minimax algorithm, Alpha-Beta pruning, MonteCarlo Tree Search","Monte Carlo algorithm, Game playing artificial intelligence, Battleship, Simulation, AI games, ",2023
Koncz Krisztian,Musical hide and seek,"Abstract
Summary The theme of my bachelor’s thesis is the development of a web application
which helps getting to know old and new acquaintances through their musical taste.
The musical taste of a person reveals a lot about their personality. Furthermore, if
we know somebody’s musical taste it is easier to start a conversation which is useful in
the early stages of a friendship.
Such an application, together with get to know you games, is a very good icebreaker,
because it can be funny to get to know somebody through music. In addition, we can get
acquainted with musical genres or songs previously unknown to us.
The online interface enables us to play even when we are not in the same location.
We can get closer to our colleagues during online classes or online work",,"Web application, Musical taste, Personality, Icebreaker, Online interface, ",2023
Bodor Benjamin,The magic of logic: steps to make puzzle games,"Abstract
Elements that contribute to the user experience and motivation of games include puzzle
games, animations, visualizations, interactions and character design itself. These important
componentsnotonlymakethegameaestheticallyappealing,butalsoensureactiveparticipation
and enjoyment for the player.
Puzzle games are exciting challenges that require creative thinking and problem-solving
skills to solve. The varied tasks encourage the player to take logical steps, combining and
matching different elements or objects to reach a solution.
Animationsandvisualizationsadddynamismandlivelinesstothegame.Thesemovements,
transitions and spectacular effects make the game world more realistic and immersive, capturing
the player’s attention. Animations help to keep the characters and their environment in motion,
adding to the interactivity and enjoyment of the game.
Interaction is one of the most important elements of the game experience, as it allows
the player to actively participate in the game world. The player’s actions and choices affect
the gameplay and story. Interaction gives the player the opportunity to control the character,
manipulate the environment and explore the possibilities of the game.
The pixel art style gives the game a unique and easily recognizable visual identity. The
appearance and attributes of characters influence the emotional connection and identification
of players with them, and the pixel art style provides a unique aesthetic experience that evokes
the atmosphere of retro games and brings back memories of the past.
These elements combine to make the game enjoyable and motivating. Interaction, inter-
esting puzzle games, animations, visualizations and good character design play a key role in
enhancing the user experience and motivating players. It is important to emphasize that the
lack of these elements, which are closely linked to the interactivity and interest of the games,
can reduce the attractiveness of the game and do not motivate the user to continue playing.","puzzle games, animation, visualization, interaction, character design, pixelart","Puzzle games, Animations, Visualizations, Interactions, Character design, ",2023
Portik Andrea,CONNECTIVE: Application to connect mentor and mentee,"Abstract
The topic of my thesis is a mobile application that connects mentors and a mentees.
Nowadays,wewanttoreacheverythingeasilyandquicklybothinourprivatelifeand
at work, and smartphones also contribute to this, as they greatly facilitate our everyday
tasks. But in a new environment or place, in order to be able to carry out the work
smoothly, it is good if someone shows us what we actually have to do. We can perform
more effectively if we have concrete goals and their corresponding specifications and
priorities.
There are two types of users in the project, mentor and mentee, who are connected
in an Android mobile application. The application allows mentors to create tasks for a
user after logging in. In addition, mentors have the option to add new members to the
group.
And the mentees are informed about the activities related to them after logging into
the application. Just like the mentors, to mentees also have the opportunity to modify
and view the tasks. The goal of the project is not for the mentor to be able to monitor
the mentee, but only guidance is the main guiding principle.
The developed application enables users to display and modify their own personal
data. All this in order to establish more connections between the mentor and the mentee,
thus facilitating more efficient work.","mentor, mentee, connect, Android application.","Mobile application, Mentors, Mentees, Android, Tasks, ",2023
Szabo Zoltan,Genetic algorithms in pattern recognition,"Abstract
Nowadays,patternrecognitionprogramsplayanincreasinglyimportantrole.Pattern
recognition programs can be used in everyday life, such as in the case of snapchat filters,
but can also be used in agriculture, such as a drone program that examines the health
of plants. Nowadays, neural networks are used in pattern recognition, but they also have
several disadvantages. These problems include high storage usage and teaching costs.
In my thesis, I present the use of genetic algorithms in pattern recognition. I present
the concept of the genetic algorithm and give an example of how it works. Then I present
the genetic algorithm I use, which I built around attribute chains in order to create a
pattern recognition program.
In my thesis, I compare a polygon in an input image with a certain predefined set
of polygons and examine which polygon is included in the input polygon. I perform the
search with a genetic algorithm, so that I examine a fitness value over several generations,
and then the member with the best value becomes the solution. I get the members in
each generation by crossing and mutating the members of the previous generation and
by using elitism on the previous generation.",,"Pattern Recognition, Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, Agriculture, Fitness Value, ",2023
Incze Zsolt Tamas,Kitchn: A Recipe Application for Modern Food Enthusiasts,"Abstract
The topic of my thesis is to develop a comprehensive application focusing on food
recipes, cooking, and gastronomy. As we know, cooking is a subject that everyone has a
direct or indirect connection to, so the target audience is very broad.
The purpose of the application is to provide easy access to the best and most diverse
recipes, as well as to inspire users to explore new dishes. The application’s intuitive user
interface and wide range of features allow users to easily browse, search, and save recipes,
as well as share their own culinary creations and opinions with the rest of the community.
The chosen technology, the Flutter framework, is a relatively new player in the
market that emphasizes cost and time efficiency. This is complemented by Firebase in
the background, which provides various services such as a database and authentication
processes. In the thesis, I will present this cross-platform technology in detail, discussing
its advantages, disadvantages, and important considerations during its usage.
This application is currently runnable on devices using iOS and Android systems,
as well as the admin interface on any web browser. It utilizes the same codebase and
dependencies. The application may have different appearances on different platforms,
making use of native elements, but the average user won’t notice any difference compared
to an application developed in native environment.
Finally, conclusions will be drawn regarding when it is advisable to use this tech-
nology and when it is not, as well as the advantages and disadvantages that users may
derive from using the application.",,"Food recipes, Gastronomy, Application, Flutter framework, Cross platform technology, ",2023
Siko Mark Levente,MuresTracker - City issue tracker,"Abstract
The topic of my paper is MuresTracker, a software that enables city residents to
report issues and facilitates efficient management of these problems by city authorities.
City administrations face numerous challenges on a daily basis that impact the quality
of life for residents. Potholes, malfunctioning streetlights, crime, safety concerns, and
similar issues are present in the daily lives of residents, and their dissatisfaction is not
always expressed in the most appropriate places. Therefore, cities require effective tools
for tracking and addressing problems.
MuresTracker addresses this problem by providing a platform for residents to report
issues and track their status, while also enabling city officials to confront and resolve
these problems. The website serves as a valuable tool for improving communication,
increasing civic engagement, monitoring and managing problems, and promoting more
efficient urban services. It offers a wide range of user-friendly reporting and tracking
capabilities and can have a positive impact on residents’ lives and the efficiency of cities.
The application allows registered regular users to add and view problems reported
by others in the city, including details, location, and who and when they were resolved.
Users with administrator roles are responsible for directing problems of a certain category
to the appropriate department. Additionally, they have insight into user information and
can modify or deactivate users in case of inappropriate behavior.","city, issues, web application, spring boot.","MuresTracker, City residents, Issues reporting, City management, Urban services, ",2023
Balazs Endre,The interactive adventures of UnitTiby: The role of algorithmic games in education,"Abstract
The topic of my paper is the role of algorithmic games in education. Nowadays, stu-
dents are growing up alongside digital technologies, using smartphones, playing computer
games, and actively participating in the online world. Compared to previous decades,
forms of entertainment have undergone significant changes, greatly influencing modern
education. Teachers need to employ new methods and techniques to sustain interest and
stimulate further learning. Gamification, or the use of game elements, is a very impor-
tant component of modern education and can provide an effective solution to changing
teaching needs.
I conducted a research study among students in Transylvania, where I gathered their
opinions on the usefulness of various game elements in relation to learning. These game
elements are all associated with gamification.
Based on my own experiences, educational games can greatly assist the learning
process. Their greatest advantage is that they allow learning useful things in a highly en-
joyable and playful manner. My goal was to create an educational game that incorporates
the game elements found to be advantageous in my research.
The purpose of the game I developed is to help users grasp the basics of the C pro-
gramming language. The protagonist of the game is a university student named UniTiby,
whomtheusercancontrol.Beforeeachtask,theplayerreceivesthenecessaryinformation
to solve the given level. Each lesson is accompanied by a maze. The user is presented with
questions and tasks that require decision-making, but by utilizing the new information,
they can navigate through the maze.
The main objective of the educational game is to avoid monotony, which is why it
features highly diverse environments. Environmental elements also appear randomly.","gamification, game elements, educational game, randomness, variety","algorithmic games, gamification, education, digital technologies, learning",2023
Fekete Daniel,Scientific journal rankings according to categories,"Abstract
In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, the need to stay connected and in-
formed has become more crucial than ever. The accessibility and usability of websites
play a significant role in facilitating efficient information retrieval and knowledge sharing.
Therefore, the primary focus of this thesis is to investigate the creation of a website that
is user-friendly and intuitive. This website aims to provide extensive rankings of academic
journals using the SCimago Journal Rank (SJR) database and its associated metrics. We
can edit scientific journals, or more precisely, we can add important information that is
not included in the database used, such as the academic year in which it was published,
or the title of the scientific article. The search results can be saved as PDF files for con-
venient access later on. Furthermore, visitors also have the opportunity to contribute to
the website’s database by adding new journals, thereby helping to expand the range of
available information. In order to gain access to the data on the website, visitors are
requested to register, enabling them to perform searches and contribute new information.
The primary objective of this thesis is to present a step-by-step guide to building a
website that is easily accessible to users worldwide, ensuring a seamless browsing experi-
ence. Throughout this research, I will explore a variety of methodologies and techniques
implemented during the development phase, offering insights into the underlying tech-
nologies that were utilized. Furthermore, this thesis aims to shed light on the evaluation
criteria employed to establish the journal ranking system within the website. By analyz-
ing and processing relevant data, the ranking methodology will be delineated, providing
users with a reliable and informed basis for their academic endeavors.

site’s accessibility for all users, regardless of their abilities",,"Website usability, Academic journals, SCimago Journal Rank (SJR) database, User registration, Accessibility measures, ",2023
Fodor Lehel,Visualization of geometric equilibrium points,"Abstract
In a two-person game the purpose of both players is obviously to win the game by
following the game’s rules and regulations. Therefore, both of the players resorts to the
strategy that results their the gratest benefit. However, there are games, when if one of
the players applies their strategy, it also benefits the other, which is obviously unfavorable
for the first mentioned player. For this reason, both players must determine the relative
frequency of using their available strategies to maximize their chances for the victory.
This problem is answered by the Nash equilibrium point, named after the American
mathematician, John Forbes Nash. In two-person games, that set of strategy in which
neither of the players can increase their profit by changing their strategy, in case of their
opponent doesn’t change their strategy, is called Nash equilibrium point.
In my thesis the main purpose is to determine the equilibrium point mentioned
above, mathematically and also in programming point of view, using the prisoner’s
dilemma problem. Besides that I will cover the following topics as well: the introduction
of basic concepts of game theory, the prisoner’s dilemma, the presentation of applied
algorithm and the interpretation of the result. To compute this equilibrium point I apply
the Lemke-Howson algorithm. For the visualization of obtained equilibrium point I use
Python as programming language.
Also belong to the goals to introduce the reader to the world of game theory and
to help users with average mathematical and information technology skill to understand
the Nash equilibrium.","two-person game, strategy, John Forbes Nash, Nash equilibrium point,Lemke-Howson algorithm, visualization.","Nash equilibrium, Game theory, Strategy, Prisoner's dilemma, Algorithm, ",2023
Pallfy Roland,Decentralized messaging and data sharing,"Abstract
Decentralized messaging and data sharing have emerged as promising approaches to
address the challenges and limitations of centralized systems in the digital era. This paper
explores the concept of decentralization in the context of messaging and data sharing,
highlighting its advantages and potential implications.
The traditional approach to messaging and data sharing relies heavily on centralized
platforms, where users’ information is stored and controlled by a single entity. However,
this centralized model has inherent limitations, including privacy concerns, data breaches,
censorship, and dependency on a single point of failure. These issues have led to growing
interest in decentralized alternatives.
Decentralized messaging systems utilize peer-to-peer networks and distributed pro-
tocols to enable direct communication between users, eliminating the need for intermedi-
aries. This approach ensures greater privacy, as users have more control over their data
and can communicate directly without relying on a central server. Additionally, decen-
tralized messaging systems can resist censorship attempts, as there is no central authority
to regulate or control the flow of information.
Similarly, decentralized data sharing aims to democratize the access and control of
data. By leveraging blockchain technology and distributed storage systems, users can se-
curely share and store data without relying on centralized entities. This enables greater
transparency, data integrity, and resilience against attacks or data loss. Moreover, de-
centralized data sharing incentivizes collaboration and innovation, as participants can
contribute and access data in a trustless and permissionless environment.
While decentralized messaging and data sharing offer numerous benefits, they also
present challenges. The scalability of decentralized systems, the verification of data au-
thenticity, and the incentivization of participants are among the key areas that require
further research and development. Additionally, legal and regulatory frameworks need to
adapt to accommodate the decentralized nature of these systems, ensuring both privacy
protection and accountability.
The aim of this thesis is to present an application based on a decentralised system
and to introduce the reader to the technologies needed to build it.",,"Decentralization, Messaging, Data sharing, Blockchain technology, Privacy concerns, ",2023
Kovacs Bence,F1 Ticket Manager - Online ticket management,"Abstract
Currently, the rapid spread of online ticket purchasing can be observed due to tech-
nological advancements and the increased accessibility of the internet. Through an online
platform, people can now conveniently and quickly purchase tickets for various events
such as concerts, theater performances, or sports events like Formula 1.
Online ticket purchasing comes with numerous advantages. Customers can easily
browse and choose from a wide range of ticket options. Online platforms provide detailed
information about events, including dates, venues, and descriptions. Additionally, online
ticket purchasing allows for ticket comparisons, price and type selections, which help
customers find the best options available.
Technological developments, such as secure online payment systems and electronic
tickets, have contributed to the widespread adoption of online ticket purchasing. Cus-
tomers can easily and safely make payments through online platforms (webshop) and
receive electronic tickets that can be presented on their mobile devices or in printable
form at the event. Online ticket purchasing simplifies event attendance, as customers no
longer have to wait in long queues at ticket counters.
The purpose of the F1 Ticket Manager application is to provide a ticket purchasing
platform for Formula 1 races. Additionally, I have implemented secure purchasing and
admission processes through two-step ticket authentication.",,"Online ticket purchasing, Technological advancements, Convenient, Electronic tickets, Formula 1, ",2023
Kovacs Lehel Levente,AlgoRythmics Universe: 3D Game Mechanics,"Abstract
With the rapid advancement of technology, numerous new possibilities have opened
up before us, fundamentally transforming our everyday lives. These changes have not
only affected communication and work but have also had an impact on entertainment
and learning.
Video games offer interactive entertainment, immersing their users in a world created
by another person. We can interact with events that we couldn’t even imagine a hundred
years ago because they seemed unrealistic to us. However, modern game development
technologies allow us to experience these in a virtual environment.
We are capable of simulating battles, constructing cities, piloting spaceships any-
where in the galaxy, or even observing the explosion of a planet. Movies or even entire
books can be adapted so that we can live through their stories interactively. The only
limit is human imagination.
Video games have not only created an entirely new and infinite world of enter-
tainment but also enable us to gamify education within the framework of schools and
universities. In every field, from finance to programming, we can find at least one game
aimed at the user’s development.
The main topic of my essay discusses the foundations of software that provide inter-
active entertainment on electronic devices. We have a multitude of software available to

Pall Arnold Barna,EventsApp,"Abstract
In today’s fast-paced world, more and more things are happening around us, and
because of this, the number of events is only increasing, so it is more difficult to follow
them day by day. Many apps have event tracking features, one of the biggest and perhaps
the most well-known is Facebook, but there the emphasis is more on interaction between
people, so the functionality of event tracker may not be the best. In our country, the use
of applications designed for similar purposes may not be as widespread as in foreign coun-
tries, but it can be challenging to find an application that can satisfy all the expectations
of the user.

Komuves David Mark,Web platform for generating and managing tax invoices,"Abstract
Today, the number of private entrepreneurs and businesses is growing. The idea of
running a business has become more normalised, it no longer seems that only someone of
the calibre of Steve Jobs or Bill Gates can run a company, so more and more young people
are trying and more new businesses are being born. However, the optimal functioning of
a modern business requires the right tools to help monitor certain behaviours, create
a successful client-provider communication interface, help manage the resources of the
business, or even shorten the time taken up by paperwork.
The aim of my thesis is to find a simple, fast and attractive solution for the latter of
these, more specifically for the generation and storage of tax invoices. The application I
have created aims to be a guaranteed solution for businesses and entrepreneurs that sell
services or products and need to generate invoice statements.
The application can be made highly accessible thanks to its web-based format. I have
created an easy-to-use schema for editing and saving invoices. The application also leaves
room for users who do not wish to log in, but for users with an account, it provides an
archive that helps not only to visualise the already created invoices, but also to highlight
them statistically.
The interface data is stored in a MongoDB database, which is managed by a Node.js

Matyus Borka Erzsebet,Visualizing furnishings in 3D room within a mobile application,"Abstract
Online shopping is thriving in today’s world. Customers strive to choose convenient
solutions for furnishing their homes, and the first step is purchasing furniture. In recent
years, online shopping has gained a significant advantage over in-person shopping with
physical contact. To achieve this, there are numerous options available to interested indi-
viduals, ranging from online stores published on websites to ordering via phone calls and
specifically developed mobile applications.
Taking these aspects into account, I have chosen a theme for my project that aligns
with current trends while also incorporating innovative technologies to enhance the user
experience. My project implements an online furniture store within an Android applica-
tion. The app provides a convenient and user-friendly interface for both the seller, who
fulfills the role of an administrator, and the buyer, who acts as a user.
From a design perspective, the user interface is clean, easily understandable, and
manageable for everyone, while also offering all the necessary functions for a seamless
shopping experience. Users can create their own accounts, allowing them to browse the
application at their leisure, favorite products for future reference, and complete the pur-
chase process.
Perhaps the only drawback of online shopping is the difficulty in physically observing
the products due to the absence of physical presence. While physical shopping allows us
to use all our senses to select and examine items from every angle, touch them, and rotate
them, online shops generally do not offer solutions to these issues.
In my project, I have endeavored to overcome this drawback by implementing a
virtual room feature that allows buyers to not only view images and read descriptions of
desired products but also observe them in 3D, rotate them, and place them proportionally
within a room. This functionality enhances the shopping experience and reduces the risk
of returns by offering customers the opportunity for more thorough observation.",,"Online shopping, Furniture, User experience, Mobile application, Virtual room, ",2023
Nyitrai Orsolya Eva,Automated baccalaureate exam result gatherer and visualizer system,"Abstract
My thesis topic is implementing an automated system that aims to collect, clean,
and visualize the baccalaureate exam results of Romanian students for the end users.
The baccalaureate exam results are of paramount importance not only for students
and teachers but also for educational institutions alike. These data greatly influence
the future possibilities of students, whether it’s about career opportunities or further
education, and they also reflect the quality of education in schools. Visualizing these
results provides an opportunity for effective evaluation of education since parents and
teachers can gain a comprehensive understanding of students’ knowledge and progress
based on the data. This can help improve the learning process and the development of
teaching programs.
In my thesis, I aimed to provide a user-friendly interface to the target audience,
which can efficiently and quickly process the given data set. I felt the need to develop
such a system because the current options for reviewing the data are limited, mostly
relying on time-consuming and manual processes, which often lead to errors or delays.
Additionally, I paid special attention to the quality of the data to ensure its consistency
and normalization for future use.
The user interface was implemented using the Next.js framework, with the assistance
of D3 and the related Recharts data visualization tools for creating visualizations.
The server-side application was built with the Nest.js framework, utilizing the Type-
Script language, and it is responsible for managing and serving the data.
The foundation of the architecture consists of the scraper and cleaning systems. The
web scraper was developed in GoLang, which is suitable for the efficient handling and
processing of large data sets. For data cleaning and pre-processing, I used the Python
language, specifically the Pandas library, which is a popular data manipulation tool. Ad-
ditionally, I worked with various other libraries and technologies, which will be discussed
in more detail later on.
The main goal in selecting the aforementioned technologies was not only to enable
easy and fast access to the data, more accurate inference drawing, and better understand-
ing of the result for everyone but also to ensure that the system is future-proof and allows
further development.",,"Automated system, Baccalaureate exam results, Data visualization, Educational institutions, User interface, ",2023
Tovisi Zoltan,SkinnyB: Calorie tracker application,"Abstract
The aim of my thesis was to create a calorie tracking application. I implemented
it using Java Spring Boot and React technologies, with a PostgreSQL database. The
application allows users to track their calorie intake and the activities that burn calo-
ries, as well as their water intake and sleep duration, as these are also important aspects
of a healthy lifestyle and weight loss. My application features a simple and user-friendly
interface to facilitate users in logging their daily calorie intake, activities, water consump-
tion, and sleep. The application enables users to easily add their meals and beverages
by providing the name, quantity, or calorie content. Users also have the option to record
their activities, including the name, duration, and calories burned. The application auto-
matically calculates the user’s daily maximum calorie intake based on the data provided
during registration through a form. In my thesis, I will present the implementation of the
design and development stages of the application. I will discuss the usage of Java Spring
Boot and React frameworks, as well as the configuration of the PostgreSQL database.
The created calorie tracking application can be a useful tool for those who want to lose
weight and track their daily calorie intake and activities to maintain a healthy lifestyle

Reszeg Alpar,The role of gameplay and rule system in 2D games,"Abstract
The aim of my thesis is to provide a detailed examination of the process involved in
designing the rule system and gameplay of 2D games, starting from the initial concept
proposal, through implementation, game testing, and error fixing. I apply this analysis
practically by developing my own educational game.
In this thesis, I focus on exploring the design paradigms defined in the literature
and investigating their practical application. Additionally, I identify areas where further
collective improvement is needed. My goal is to understand how these paradigms can be
applied in game design practice and how they contribute to enhancing the overall gaming
experience.
I present a detailed overview of the technologies I utilize in the development and
testing of the game. Subsequently, I provide an overview of the implemented software,
including the rule system, gameplay mechanics, and graphical representation. Moreover,
I assess the limitations of the current program and propose suggestions for further devel-
opment opportunities.
As a result of this thesis, I offer a comprehensive understanding of the process of
designing and developing 2D games, which can assist game developers and designers in
effectively creating rule systems and gameplay mechanics. Furthermore, I identify areas
that require further research and advancement in the field of game design.","2D games, rule system, gameplay, design paradigms, educational game,game development, graphical representation, game design, development process.","Game design, Rule system, Gameplay mechanics, Educational game, Technology utilization, ",2023

Tanko Tamas,Examining social phenomena in a real company’s email communication network,"Abstract
The topic of my paper is the examination of social phenomena in a real company’s
email communication network, where I compare the execution times of algorithms applied
to different graphs. Through these operations, I connect social phenomena with computer
algorithms and graph theory. In a favorable scenario, I did not work with fictional ele-
ments, but used the real email communication database of the ENRON company. In
the research, I also conducted data mining to exclusively examine internal relationships
within the company, thereby reducing the number of nodes used in the graph.
During my interdisciplinary research, I utilized various graph-theoretical algorithms
such as depth-first search and the Girvan-Newman method.

allowing us to track the formation of connections, which can be visualized as well.",,"Social phenomena, Email communication network, Algorithms, Graph theory, Data mining, ",2023
Kocsis Lorand,Flexible work program follower,"Abstract
Thetopicofmythesisismonitoringflexibleworkschedules,whichprovidesasolution
to the challenges encountered when a workplace adopts a flexible work program and
tracking employees’ entries and exits becomes a complex task, especially when remote
workisallowed,whichisbecomingincreasinglycommon,particularlyforofficejobs.There
are two main reasons why solving this problem is necessary: the company can track the
number of hours worked by employees per day and comply with the monthly requirement
of submitting attendance sheets to the state.
The aim of my project is to offer a relatively simple solution for monitoring em-
ployees’ working hours and recording their breaks, as well as meeting legal requirements.
Employees can register their entry and exit from the system with a single button press.
Additionally, the system provides the capability to generate attendance sheet documents
for predetermined periods or time intervals, for accounting purposes. Such corporate is-
sues are addressed by Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, so I have developed
a module in the paper that communicates with a database and a website that interacts
with this system.",,"Flexible work schedules, Monitoring, Remote work, Attendance tracking, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), ",2023
Simon Csaba,SmartCalendar Notification App,"Abstract

their time more efficiently and plan their daily life better. The app helps them anticipate
and manage events so they don’t miss important appointments or commitments. It also
helps you avoid chaos caused by unexpected events, because by managing your time,
there will be fewer surprises and less stress. SmartCalendar not only helps you manage
your time, it also manages your appointments as a service provider. It allows businesses to
easily and automatically notify their customers of scheduled services. This means signifi-
cant ease and efficiency for service providers, as clients receive timely notifications so they
don’t forget or miss appointments. The app is designed to provide access to scheduling
and customer notification functionality for any business, regardless of size or form. This
means that even small service providers who could not previously afford to develop such
an application can use it. SmartCalendar therefore provides an opportunity to ensure
that customers are informed in a timely manner and do not forget scheduled services.
The paper describes in detail how the application works and how it provides customer
notification. It also shows how the application can make this functionality available to
users free of charge. SmartCalendar opens up new opportunities for more efficient time
management and the development of small businesses.",,"SmartCalendar, Time management, Customer notification, Service providers, Efficiency, ",2023
Burszan Hunor,Exploring Distribution Forecasting with Amazon Forecast,"Abstract
Demand forecasting is an extremely important and valuable activity in many in-
dustries and business environments. Accurate forecasting allows companies to effectively
manage inventory, optimise their design and manufacturing processes, develop sales and
marketing strategies, reduce costs and increase efficiency. One of the main benefits of
demand forecasting is the ability to manage inventory efficiently, as it allows companies
to minimise stock shortages and overstocks, optimise stock levels and reduce storage and
warehousing costs. Demand forecasting also helps to optimise design and production pro-
cesses. Forecasting allows companies to plan their production capacity, adjust production
schedules and make more efficient use of available resources. It also enables companies
to better understand their customers’ needs and behaviour. This allows the development
of personalised product offerings, the optimisation of sales and marketing strategies and
the delivery of a better customer experience. It helps companies to improve customer
satisfaction and loyalty by enabling companies to accurately reach and meet customer
needs based on predictions.
Effective inventory management is partly based on good demand forecasting. Not
only does insufficient inventory cause customer dissatisfaction and loss of revenue, but
if it happens often enough, or at an important enough time for a customer, it can also
result in the loss of future business. However, oversupply is costly in terms of storage and
logistics, and some stock can remain unsold for a long time - or even forever - resulting in
a total loss of investment. Finding the right stock balance is therefore an essential aspect
of good demand forecasting.
Over the years, there have been significant developments in the field of demand
forecasting.Thecontinuousdevelopmentofforecastingmethodsandtechniques,aswellas
the increase in the quantity and quality of data available, has had a significant impact on
theaccuracyandreliabilityofforecasting.Inaddition,improvementsindatamanagement
and processing have also led to significant progress. Developments in data mining and
machine learning algorithms allow the analysis of complex data sets and the identification
of hidden patterns, thus helping to produce more accurate and reliable forecasts.
The aim of this paper is to predict the future demand distribution of some prod-
ucts by demonstrating the process of creating a time series forecast using the Amazon
Forecast web service, which does not require prior knowledge of machine learning and
artificial intelligence. The paper presents the complete process required to produce the
forecasts, including the associated logic, and the desktop application designed to manage
the Forecast by communicating with the service. The results of the forecasts are displayed

Gabos Alpar,EduLane: Course Guide in Your Pocket,"Abstract
The topic of my thesis is to simplify learning through online courses using software.
Withthehelpofmoderntechnologiesusedtoday,almostanythingcanbelearnedthrough
online courses. This form of online learning is becoming increasingly popular, resulting
in a growing number of such courses available on the market, which makes it increasingly
difficult to choose the ones that are truly relevant for us.
Online courses are available from an increasing number of providers. However, in
order to find the ideal one for us, we have to explore multiple learning platforms, which
can be a time-consuming task. In this case, it is important to be able to find the most
suitable course from as many sources as possible in the shortest possible time, particularly
on a specific topic.
In my thesis, I aim to present a software that can facilitate this course search process.
The main purpose of developing the software is to allow individuals who want to learn
to see the courses in one place, combining various courses from the mentioned learning
platforms. Additionally, it is important that the software’s users are able to save these
courses and track their progress.
During the design and development process, I have also taken into account the ex-
periences of other similar applications in order to provide new and innovative features to
users. The thesis will provide a detailed presentation of the application’s structure, the
technologies used, and the access and processing of the courses.
Finally, the completed software will be presented, demonstrating in practice how
previously identified problems were solved and what functionalities the software enables.","coursecollection,onlinelearning,software,technology,learningplatform","online courses, software, learning platforms, course search, learning facilitation.",2023
Magyari Dora,Personalized content recommandation,"Abstract
I chose the personalized content recommendation system of websites as the topic of
mythesis,becauseuserexperienceanduniquecontentareessentialforsuccessfulwebsites.
A personalized content recommendation system allows users to access content that is a
relevant to their interests. This can increase time spent on this site, improve return rates
and build a deeper relationship with the site.
The benefits of personalized content recommendation include a unique user expe-
rience, increased relevance of content and increased user satisfaction. The system takes
into account users browsing history and habits, using different algorithms to provide them
with more accurate recommendations. This makes it easier for users to find content that
matches their interests and discover new things.
My thesis presents a website with images by category. I have chosen to do this
because I find the role of images on this type of website extremely important in attracting
attention. Images are attractive and quickly attract the attention of users. Therefore, a
content recommendation system full of images is an excellent opportunity to capture the
interest of users in an entertaining way.
My content recommendation is implemented by measuring the time spent on images.
measuring time spent on images can help to increase the effectiveness of content recom-
mendation. If users spend more time looking at or exploring images, it may indicate that
the content is interesting or attractive to them. This information allows the system to
draw conclusions about users preferences and tastes. For example, if someone looks at
sports photos for a longer period of time, it may indicate that they are interested in this
type of content. Based on this, the system can recommend further similar content, which
is more likely to attract teh interest.",,"Personalized content recommendation, User experience, Unique content, Browsing history, Images, ",2023
Horvath Janos,Learn programming and test our knowledge with online tests,"Abstract
The topic of my thesis is the development of a mobile application that facilitates
learning and mastering the basics of programming for beginners, while providing constant
practice through various tests. The application is accompanied by a website where users
can create new tests, edit categories, and track their results.
To create the application and website, I utilized various technologies. My thesis also
includes an API that enables communication between the website and the application,
using a shared database. The learning approach in the application is based on tests and
quizzes, as in today’s fast-paced world, our smartphones are always within reach, allowing
us to practice with just a few minutes of our time. The test-based learning approach
provides an enjoyable and interactive learning experience, making learning more effective.
Administrators have the ability to continuously expand the learning opportunities of
the application by adding questions and categories through the website. They can also
monitor user activities and perform basic administrative tasks.
The completed application can be beneficial for university students, especially first-
year students or those preparing for entrance exams who are just beginning to explore
the world of computer science.

Major Zsolt,Create and import basketball league and statistical survey data into .Net Maui,"Abstract
In the realm of competitive sports, it is not uncommon for individuals who follow
a contest from the sidelines to immerse themselves in the world of competition to such
a degree, that they passionately cheer for a favorite side or even place bets on certain
competitors. The competitive curiosity of humans can manifest in various ways, ranging
from the frenzy of cheering alongside numerous other fans at a live match to everyday
conversations with friends at a bar on who will win today’s big game. Building upon this
idea, I have developed a computer application that offers two important possibilities for
users to solve dilemmas that arise in the realm of basketball championships: a system
for importing and recording team and player performances, which enables us to create
complex and advanced insights not only into an athlete’s personal statistics, but also to
compare them with those of another party, and a championship creation program where
we can form teams led by others, engage in matches with them, and maintain rankings
based on those matches.
To implement this system, I have developed a .Net MAUI program based on the C#
language. It utilizes a MySQL-based phpMyAdmin database system to store and retrieve
data for teams, players, and their statistics. Additionally, through an API, there is a
possibility to fetch statistics of real NBA players and teams for different seasons, which
will be used to create multi-layered metric measurements.
My application can be divided into three distinctive menu sections. The first one is
the league creator, where users can employ personally created clubs in various matches.
Within this section, they can assign statistics and final results to players associated
with the teams, and also rank the teams and players based on different criterias. The
second section is the team and player creator, where users can create teams, customize
them, and also retrieve and store the seasonal performances of real teams and players
in the database. The third section, which is also a crucial one, is the comparation and
evaluation section, where imported teams and players can be evaluated and compared
using different convoluted metrics and graphs based on the imported information based
on their performance.","basketball, personalized championship, match maintenance, compar-isons, statistics, metrics, competitional curiosity, datamining","Competitive sports, Computer application, Basketball championships, .Net MAUI program, MySQL database, ",2023

Jakab Etele,Stock price prediction and visualization,"Abstract
One of the most studied sectors of economics and financial analysis is stock trading,
where participants buy and sell shares on the stock exchange or other financial markets.
It can be said that this is the most dynamic area for investors in capitalist countries,
which has numerous advantages but also carries several critical risks.
The biggest advantage of this industry is that investors can quickly gain substantial
profits from the rise of stock prices or periodic dividend payments. However, due to price
volatility, one must also consider the possibility of losses resulting from sudden drops in
stock prices. Investors need proper knowledge and experience to trade successfully and
minimize risks.
The fluctuation of stock prices depends on various factors such as the economic
environment, political situation, market trends, and corporate performance. Examining
and analyzing these factors is a highly complex process, given that stock price changes
are triggered by intricate impulses rooted in high levels of abstraction.
The thesis consists of two main chapters. The first chapter focuses on a desktop ap-
plication built with Python and Tkinter, presenting its structure, operational principles,
and already implemented functionalities. The second chapter introduces two indepen-
dently developed and separate prediction systems, as well as a third approach resulting
from their combination. The first system is based on deep learning neural networks, while
the second operates using classification algorithms in the approach of news analysis.
The aim during the development of the desktop application was to enable it to work
with data from nearly a hundred publicly traded companies, automatically update them,
process them using multiple analytical methods, and present the results to the user using
visualization tools. From a program design perspective, I followed the modern principle
of allowing for easy expansion and post-development modifications of the application.
The research section aimed to develop a method capable of providing highly accurate
predictions regarding market changes based on past market data and news feeds. These
methods were tested, results were documented, compared with each other, and essential
conclusions were drawn.
The social goal of the research is to facilitate safer stock market investments and
protect people’s savings, particularly during a period when economic prospects are rather
turbulent. In 2022, the average annual inflation in the European Union was 10.4%, in
Hungary 24.5%, in Romania 14.1%, while in the Eurozone it reached 9.2%. In contrast,
the average annual deposit interest rates in Hungary were 6.1%, and in Romania, they
reached 7.2%.",,"Stock trading, Investment risks, Economic factors, Prediction systems, Financial markets, ",2023
Veres Napsugar Anna,SimultanQ - the Design and Development of an Interactive Quiz Game,"Abstract
The topic of my thesis is to implement an interactive quiz game without restricting
the number of participating players using a web application.
Quiz games are extremely popular nowadays and offer numerous advantages. People
enjoy challenges, especially when presented in a playful form. Live quiz games provide an
exciting and interactive experience as they allow players to compete with each other and
test their knowledge. The multiplayer mode facilitates all of this.
The fact that players participate simultaneously in the quiz game and there is the
possibility of real-time tracking of results makes the game even more thrilling and can
have a community-building impact.
The name of my application is ""SimultanQ,"" which aims to represent this concept.
""Simultan"" refers to shared, simultaneous activities, while the suffix ""Q"" stands for ""Quiz.""
Analyzing existing online and freely accessible similar applications reveals that the
number of participants is limited during the game. Within the scope of this project, a
web application has been developed without such restrictions. Users can easily register,
create quizzes after logging in, and start the game in a straightforward manner. They
can enable players to join the quiz by sharing a PIN code, and the players can access the
questions based on this information.
The application contributes to the realization of beloved challenges, the implemen-
tation of engaging games in various topics for different groups, testing knowledge, and
the competitive approach can provide a genuine team-building experience.","quizgame, interactive, challenges","Interactive quiz game, Web application, Multiplayer mode, Real-time tracking, SimultanQ, ",2023

Stoica Attila,Visualizer for dynamic programming algorithms,"Abstract
The topic of my paper is visualizing the algorithm of dynamic programming through
an easily applicable interface. Dynamic programming is an efficient and creative method
for problem-solving. Its foundation lies in storing and reusing optimal solutions. It’s a bit
like a memory game, where by leveraging previous steps, you can more easily find the
solution. This saves time and resources. It is used in optimization, computer graphics,
and artificial intelligence.
The clear presentation of dynamic programming is extremely important for students.
Imagine inviting them on an exciting adventure into the world of problem-solving. Show
them how they can break down complex tasks into simpler subproblems, and by solving
these, they can eventually reach the complete solution. Enrich the lesson with examples
and practical applications, allowing them to see how dynamic programming can assist
them in various areas of life, such as data analysis or video game development. By incor-
poratinguniqueinteractiveexercisesandcreativeapproaches,youpiquestudents’interest

of their creativity, logical thinking, and ability to work in teams.
The goal of my paper is to present dynamic programming as comprehensively and
uniquely as possible, thereby capturing students’ attention and laying the foundation for
their future IT skills. I aimed to achieve this through a website, primarily because it is
easily accessible and applicable to anyone.
Furthermore, it was crucial for the visualization to be carried out through tasks
that perfectly reflect the fundamental properties of the algorithm, such as dividing prob-
lems into subproblems and memoization. Additionally, I strived to create a user-friendly
interface where the visualization speed can also be adjusted.",,"Dynamic programming, Visualization, Problem solving, Memory game, Interactive exercises, ",2023
Kiss Krisztina Gyongyver,TastyGo: Application for a restaurant with delivery,"Abstract
The restaurant industry and online ordering options have seen rapid growth in recent
years, creating a growing demand for convenient and easy food delivery. People want to
bring the restaurant experience to their homes without sacrificing comfort and relaxation.
In this digital age, restaurants need to keep up with consumer demands and find ways to
serve customers in the online space. This is where a restaurant delivery app comes into
play, allowing for easy and fast food ordering and delivery.
The goal is to create an application that enables the restaurant to provide customers
with a convenient and simple way to order from their menu. Through the app, customers
can browse a wide range of dishes, view detailed descriptions and prices, and easily create
their order. The app also allows for online payment, ensuring a seamless process for both
users and the restaurant.
The benefits of a delivery app extend beyond customer convenience and also result
in more efficient and successful restaurant operations. With the app, the restaurant can
easily manage orders, track the delivery process, and optimize resources. Additionally,
the app enables customer data management and the building of customer relationships,
which can lead to loyal customers and positive feedback in the long run.

Torok Csongor,Algorythmics on the Chessboard,"Abstract
Throughout history, only a very few things, apart from its minor improvements,
have remained almost unchanged from the early Middle Ages to our present times, still
representing the same board game for millions of people. It doesn’t have any hidden parts
or any elements of chance, everything stands in front of the two players from the very
beginning to until the checkmate.
In spite of all these, one of the biggest change brought to chess were the programs
and algorithms made by computer scientist from the past decades. These offered a deeper
insight into the world of chess, calculating the best steps from any given position, from an
unfathomable number of choices. As these programs evolved, the game received a whole
new dimension of depth, since we could analyze every single detail, the most optimal
strategy could be generated in mere seconds.
With my thesis, I would like to expand the ranks of these programs, looking to
solve chess problems and puzzles, which even thousands of years ago could have occupied
people.
My algorithms show step-by-step how they find solutions for the given cases, with
added explanations. My goal, in addition to chess’ complexity, is to clarify these algo-
rithms for anyone, with an interactive interface.
My chess algorithms look for solutions to these problems in several ways, in a given
example they choose the best steps by analyzing the current situation or they get a
solution by testing all the possible cases. By saving the running times, I tried to present
the chess problems in easily understandable and visually pleasing way with the help of
the most effective methods.
Last but not least, popularizing chess, arousing interest in it for others was another
goal of mine, since anyone can be an expert of the game of kings, similar programs can
help a lot in mastering it.",,"Chess, Algorithms, Evolution, Solutions, Complexity, ",2023
Bakó László Mihály,Open doors with human-machine interface: a new approach to password-free secure access,"Abstract
In this thesis, we have explored the possibility of using human-machine interfaces
as a new approach to password-free secure access and user authentication. In the pro-
posed approach, the active interface, which monitors some biometric process, serves as
a non-transferable authentication token based on a secure “dead man switch”. If the
connection is terminated, the system automatically revokes the privileges and logs the
user out. To avoid forgery and impersonation, the system uses a one-time key protected
communication protocol between the clients and the server managing access to resources.
In this research, we analyzed possible solutions based on the criteria of security,
convenience and cost-effectiveness, and implemented a system based on a comfortable
wearable visual cortex activity monitor and a low-cost heart rate monitoring system. The
completed systems were tested to assess their reliability and safety.
The results of the research show that the combination of non-transferable authenti-
cation tokens, biometrics and communication protocol offers a promising alternative to
password or simple token-based access control systems, as it improves security and allows

In today’s fast-paced world, individuals and businesses engaged in real estate trans-
actions often encounter significant challenges when drafting property sale contracts. The
creation of these property sale contracts is an integral part of real estate transactions, in-
volving complex legalities and meticulous documentation. There is a pressing need for an
intuitive tool that can alleviate these complexities and facilitate the creation of accurate
and legally compliant contracts.
The aim of my thesis is two-fold. Firstly, I intend to create the basis of an online
platform to allow the automatic creation of contracts to facilitate secure property sales.
This includes the creation and planification of the necessary software architecture, the
creation of an easy to use administration interface, as well as the verbatim generation
and filling out of PDF documents using templates created by the administrators. Sec-
ondly, I intend to document the various stages (and possibilities) of the final deployment,
measured within real-world conditions.
The proposed website serves as a comprehensive platform, offering users a friendly
interface to generate legally binding contracts tailored to their specific requirements. By
eliminating the need for extensive legal knowledge or the assistance of costly attorneys,
the time and effort required to create a contract is greatly reduced.
Comparatively, governments worldwide have implemented similar software solu-
tions to address the challenges associated with property sale contracts. However, these
government-backed endeavours are often significantly handicapped by their perceived ob-
scurity and their convoluted design choices. This platform aims to provide users with a
unique and simplified experience that surpasses existing government initiatives.
In the beginning of the thesis we will discuss the various technologies employed to
create the proposed software solution. Afterwards, we will describe what the software
will do and how it will be expected to perform as part of a Software Requirements
Specification. A prospective user interface for the platform will be detailed following
the proposal of a potential software architecture and deployment layout. Finally, some
measurements will be presented to rationalize the decisions taken during the planning
stages of the software architecture.","Property contracts, Document templates, PDF document generation,Docker deployment, Serverless technologies.","Real estate transactions, Property sale contracts, Online platform, Software architecture, Legally compliant, ",2023
Csegzi Hunor,System to collect and elaborate data in superior education,"Abstract
In my dissertation, I developed a system to collect and elaborate data in superior
education to ensure quality. I started to develop a web application, in which it is possible
to create statements, modify tables containing data, delete, overwrite data, and upload
them in Excel format. The software helps anyone who has access to it, enter data, and
organize transparent data sets from displayed tables.
Priortothedevelopment,Iconsideredseveralalternativesolutions,butinconclusion,
the technology I chose proved to be the most effective. This technology is the RDLC
report, which was initially unknown to me as well, thus I learned and discovered it both
during the development process of my dissertation and during the writing process. The
most important of the many advantages of this solution is the easy editing, which can be
dynamically edited and implemented in XML format, but last but not least it is easier
to implement with the system packages I have chosen.
The development of the system was guided by opinions who has to elaborate data
to create reports. The elaboration of data has been, and will continue to be necessary, so
I kept it important throughout my software development to keep the project sustainable
and functional in the long run with minimal development. I created the system with the
information obtained during the research and taking into account the needs and requests
of the target user, as the most important thing is that the user community accepts it and
is happy to use it. This solid, analytical platform also simplifies the day-to-day tasks of
teachers involved in education, but provides a simple, clean, usable interface during the
years.
With the simplicity and efficiency in mind, I have written my dissertation, the main
functionality of which is the elaboration of reports, embedded in a user interface that
meets the current design conditions, where the competent user can understand the soft-
ware and easily find the desired information to access this function. Thus, the system and
website I have designed and implemented provides a user-friendly environment for both
clients and the designer.","RDLC, elaboration, web","system development, web application, data organization, RDLC report, user-friendly interface.",2023
Molnar Krisztian,Visualizations of large collections of images,"Abstract
Currently, we have access to large image collections both personally and in research.
Visualizing these collections can contribute to the discovery of latent patterns.
The topic of my thesis is the display and visualization of large image collections in
various layouts. The size of the image collections I used exceeds forty thousand images,
but the theoretical upper limit surpasses this by far.
I have developed an application that can display the images from the opened collec-
tion and arrange them based on extracted metadata, all within seconds.
My application is built on a client-server architecture. The server is written in the
Rust[rus23] programming language using the Axum framework. The client, running in the
browser, is built in TypeScript[typ23] and consists of two main parts. The desired layout
can be selected through a user interface created with the React[rea23] framework, and
this code is also responsible for the settings of the selected layout. The part responsible
for image display does not use a framework but follows a custom-designed architecture.
The WebGL[web23] library is used for rendering the images.
The application has gone through several development cycles. I will now present the
design decisions necessary for displaying image collections of this size and support them
with measurements.
Furthermore, I will showcase the layouts generated by the application for the collec-
tion I used.","images, display, collections, layouts, clustering","Large image collections, Visualization, Display, Layouts, Metadata, ",2023
Kolumban Attila,Rubik’s cube solver for phones,"Abstract
The Rubik’s Cube is one of the worlds most iconic and most interesting puzzle
game. The first Rubik’s Cube was made in the year 1974 by Rubik Ernő, who was a
Hungarian architect, sculptor and game designer. Since its inception, it became popular
worldwide, it entertains millions of people every day. Solving the Rubik’s Cube demands
attention, patients and strategic thinking of its user, but thanks to improvements of
modern technology, the way of thinking needed to solve the cube is a lot easier to learn.
Thanks to the improvements of our smart devices and automated robots, solving
the Rubik’s Cube reached new levels. These days Rubik’s Cube solver application are
available on personal computers, and also on smart phones, making the learning of new
solving algorithms a lot easier. Usually an application like this show a 3D representation
of a Rubik’s Cube on the screen of the device, which can be rotated by the user using
fingers or a mouse. The applications then calculate an optimal solution, and shows it to
the user. The user can copy these steps on his own cube, this way he can devolop his own
skills. Usually its a plus, if the application is not only able to show an optimal solution,
but also can show given solving algorithms, this way helping the user understand the
cube more.
My software is able to read in a real cube, using the camera of a smart device, this
way speeding up the process of inputting the state of the cube into the application. After
the scanning of the cube is done, the user can ask for an optimal solution, of which he
can go through step by step, or if he feels like it, he can try to solve the cube himself.
Aside from this, i wanted to implement a feature, where the user can learn given solving
algorithms. For this reason exists a separate menu, where the user can choose a solving
algorithm, and can see its steps on the cube.
The application was made in Unity, using C#, and for finding an optimal solution
i used Kociemba’s two step solving algorithm. This algorithm is well liked for its speed
and low solution step count.",,"Rubik's Cube, Solver application, Technology improvements, Smart devices, Solving algorithms, ",2023

The topic of my thesis is the design and implementation of a system that makes the management 
of events of university open days easier and more transparent for both the organizers and participants. 
University open days are an annual event aimed at promoting the university among high school 
students and providing insight into its operation for those interested. This is an extremely important 
process because an outsider can really only get a deeper look into university life here before deciding 
to apply. There are several tasks involved in organizing an event, such as managing information 
related to the event and participants, which are slow and cumbersome to solve with traditional 
methods, hence the need for a system that makes the whole process more effortless and faster. 
The aim of my thesis is to create a system that offers solutions to the aforementioned problems, 
using the advantages of two modern frameworks. My system makes it more accessible to transfer 
information related to events, save participant related data, and create statistics from the existing 
dataset for the organizers. 
The system consists of three parts. I implemented the mobile application using the Flutter 
framework, which must be installed on users' phones and is platform-independent. Here, depending 
on their role, users can register, create new events, modify existing events, sign up for events, and 
generate statistics. In the background, a Spring Boot application runs, which provides access to the 
data stored in the database and processes and saves the data generated by the mobile application. 
The third part is the cloud-based storage provided by Firebase, where I store the images, and the 
MySQL relational database, where I store all other data.","platform-independent, mobile application, Flutter, Spring Boot, event.","University open days, System design, Event management, Modern frameworks, Mobile application, ",2023

In the modern and rapidly evolving world, there is electric technology behind all our 
needs, hobbies, and work, which we use comfortably and without problems. In current times, 
with the increase in inflation, the prices of all necessities have risen, especially electricity. 
Therefore, if we do not pay attention to our daily energy consumption and do not make changes 
in our energy usage habits, we can easily encounter financial difficulties. 
The aim of my thesis is to develop an IoT (Internet of Things) system that enables easy 
measurement and monitoring of energy consumption of electronic devices within a household. 
Additionally, the system is capable of monitoring the production of solar panels installed in the 
household. The data is stored in a database, allowing for future statistical analysis and insights. 
This provides a more accurate understanding of energy costs and helps optimize consumption 
while leveraging renewable energy sources. 
The different units communicate with each other through the MQTT protocol, where 
publishers (household appliances, solar panels) send sampled data to the broker (Raspberry Pi),

Nowadays, using sensors has become so popular that we do not even notice how easy it is 
for us to measure the world around us. Today we have the possibility and the technology to 
measure the physical, chemical and the biological characteristics of the world around us. 
The goal of my thesis was to build a scalable system for sensors, created with the help of 
an Arduino, which helps in the integration of new sensors in the system for users, who may face 
a challenge when integrating a new sensor in an environment with Arduino and microcontrollers. 
At the beginning I had to create a text-based protocol, written with ASCII code, which 
provides for the user an interface for dynamic configuration of the sensors and for the collective 
data forwarding.  
Several different sensors have been integrated into the sensor system, with which it is 
possible to measure different physical quantities and monitor changes in values, but also an 
interface for the collected data. 
For the better understanding of the real-time data collected by the sensors with the help of 
the Arduino I have also created a desktop application,, through which the real-time data 
measured by the sensors connected to the Arduino can be displayed, and it is also possible to 
save and review the data. The communication between the application and the sensors is realized 
by serial communication.

In human life, one of the most important and valuable things is time. In today's fast-paced

emerged, making people's lives easier. We can even say that we are living in the era of smart

My thesis’ topic encompasses such a system. It helps us not only to save time, but also 
relieves us from a responsibility. This modern and innovative solution allows us to take care of 
our plants in the best possible way while minimizing the tasks of plant care and maximizing the 
health and beauty of our flowers. It assists in maintaining the plants in optimal condition, especially 
when we are not at home or don't have enough time for their care. The system's sensors and 
controllers monitor the environmental parameters of the plants, such as temperature, humidity, 
light intensity, and their watering needs. 
The smart flowerpot system automatically regulates watering, ensuring that the plants 
always receive the right amount of water at the right time. We no longer need to worry about 
overwatering or underwatering, as the system takes precise care of watering our flowers. 
Through an interactive and user interface, we can easily set the watering schedule, monitor 
the plants' condition, and track the environmental parameters. Whether we are at home or away, 
the system allows remote access, enabling us to stay connected with our flowers and intervene 
when necessary. 
For the control of the system, I have used an ESP32 microcontroller. The ESP32 is an 
extremely versatile and powerful platform that enables full control and monitoring of my smart

Today, diagnostic methods in medicine are constantly evolving, and we can now apply 
techniques that were unimaginable before. Among the new possibilities and technological 
challenges, I aim to find solutions that can help us recognize and treat common cardiovascular 
diseases more effectively, thereby preventing premature or avoidable deaths. 
The main goal of my research is to develop new and advanced diagnostic systems specifically 
focused on the characteristics of cardiovascular diseases. These systems would enable more 
accurate and efficient diagnoses during the identification and treatment of these diseases. The 
foundation of my approach is the utilization of electrocardiography (ECG) signals in medicine. 
These signals provide precise and detailed information about the heart's electrical activity, 
making it possible to detect various heart diseases or other abnormalities. 
The first step involves preprocessing the signals, applying filtering and other normalization 
techniques. Then, I create an RGB color-channel image, a spectrogram. The spectrogram is a 
visual representation that shows the frequency spectrum of the signal over time. Different shades 
of color in the channels indicate the intensity of the frequencies, making it easier to analyze the 
structure and changes of the signal. This process helps extract essential information from the 
signals and reduces distortions caused by noise. 
These images serve as the input dataset for my deep learning-based training software, whose 
main task is to recognize four specific diseases. Therefore, my system will be able to identify 
patterns or subtle details that are not visible to the human eye, providing more accurate diagnoses 
for people. This can significantly contribute to improving healthcare outcomes and enhancing the 
quality of life.","deep learning, cardiovascular diseases, spectrogram, signal filtering, diseasediagnosis.","Cardiovascular diseases, Electrocardiography (ECG) signals, Diagnostic systems, Spectrogram, Deep learning, ",2023

Our research methodology was based on studying existing solutions, conducting our
own experiments and collecting data. We applied the transfer learning technique to the

Based on the results, we were able to develop a graphical user interface that allows
automatic classification of chest radiographs and diagnosis of pneumonia. The neural net-
work with GoogleNet architecture achieved outstanding accuracy on the tested dataset,
and compared to our own classification network, produced significantly better results,
similar to the results of the networks studied in the literature.
Based on these results, we conclude that a well-written neural network interoperating
with the GoogleNet architecture can effectively detect pneumonia based on chest X-ray.

Abstract 
 
Industrial robots are more and more wide-spread in various manufacturing and logistics processes, 
where accuracy, speed, and safety are important factors. Robots are capable of automating tasks 
that are boring, dangerous, or too complex for humans. However, the collaboration between robots 
and humans represents challenges, especially when robots need to adapt flexibly to changing 
environments and tasks. 
 
The recognition and manipulation of small objects are tasks widely used in industrial and 
educational contexts. However, determining the type and positioning of these objects is not always 
straightforward, particularly when they have similar colors or sizes. In this paper, I present a 
method that enables the Baxter robot to easily differentiate cubes using ArUco markers. I describe 
how I programmed the Baxter robot to determine the type and position of cubes on a workspace 
and arrange them accordingly. Throughout my study, I provide a detailed presentation of the 
system's design, implementation, and testing. 
 
In my paper, I have developed a system that can control the Baxter robot to recognize and 
manipulate cuboid-shaped objects. The system consists of three main components: an image 
processing module that detects and identifies objects using the OpenCV and cv2.aruco libraries, a 
communication module that uses the ZMQ protocol to send and receive data, and a robot control 
module that utilizes the ROS (Robot Operating System) libraries to control the robot's arms and 
grippers. During the operation of the system, the robot captures an image of the workspace, 
determines the position and type of objects, and performs sorting based on this information.

under Python with pre-sampled raw guitar sound files. In the second phase, the algorithms were 
tested on a self-developed multimedia system with an STM32G491 microcontroller using 
artificially generated and synthesized signals. The quality of the effects was tested using both 
objective and subjective methods.","digital signal processing, sound effects, ARM programming, Python simulation","digital sound effect unit, digital signal processing, algorithm design, hardware implementation, STM32G491 microcontroller",2023
Bacs Bernat,  Proiectarea și dezvoltarea unui  sistem de control al casei inteligente ,"Abstract 
 
 
 This thesis presents the implementation of a smart home control system. The system mainly 
performs home automation tasks such as temperature control, watering of plants and automatic 
movement of shutter, thus facilitating the user's daily life. Nowadays, IoT devices are playing an 
increasingly important role for people, and we can't imagine our lives without them. Since most 
people have an internet connection at home, building such an IoT system is easier, cheaper and 
more efficient because there is no need for wires to communicate between devices. 
 The system I developed and built consists of a central computer with a touch screen display 
connected to it, where you can follow and intervene in the automation processes, you can see 
statistics about the temperature in the room, for example. Several sensors are connected to this 
central part via Bluetooth or MQTT communication protocols, which provide data and perform 
the automation tasks. In my thesis I document the design and construction of this system in detail, 
illustrating each part with diagrams.","IoT, Home-automation, Raspberry Pi, MQTT","5 keywords: smart home control system, IoT devices, automation tasks, sensors, central computer",2023

Abstract 
The topic of the project is to develop a web application that connects students, companies, and 
universities during their internships. The goal is to develop a user-friendly platform capable of 
managing the entire process related to internships. 
 One of the major objectives of the project is for the application to function as a 
professional-oriented social platform for students and companies, thereby facilitating the 
development of professional relationships and nurturing partnerships between companies and 
universities. 
 Another important objective of the project is to provide students with recommendations 
on the platform based on their profiles and fields of study. This allows them to find relevant 
opportunities in the field of internships. The algorithms of my recommendation system, using 
techniques like Cosine Similarity, consider the students' skills, interests, and the requirements set 
by the companies. Thus, the platform helps students find the most suitable internship positions, 
optimizing the related processes and ensuring the effectiveness of the internships. 
 To develop the project, I am using modern web technologies such as Angular, Java 
Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and AWS. These technologies help make the platform robust, scalable, 
secure, and fast.","Internship, Recommendation System, Cosine Similarity, Angular, Spring Boot","Web application, Internship, Platform, Recommendation system, Modern web technologies, ",2023

Abstract 
 
 
In recent years, the application of industrial robots has witnessed significant growth. Their 
expanding applications and increasing functionality enable them to perform a wider range of 
human tasks. In this thesis, our research focused on developing a system that records user 
movements and utilizes them to calculate the necessary control signals for an industrial robot. 
Specifically, we designed a solution for the remote control of a two-armed industrial robot based 
on human arm movements.  
To achieve real-time control of both robot arms, we utilized a second-generation Kinect sensor, 
known for its motion tracking and distance measurement capabilities. The data captured by the 
Kinect sensor was subsequently transformed into a suitable format for controlling the robot arm. 
The developed control approach is based on the angle measurement of the users limbs, and based 
on this information the joints of the robot arm can be directly controlled.  
Our implementation applies a Baxter cooperative robot. Baxter is a fixed platform robot, 
equipped with two robotic arms, featuring seven degrees of freedom each. The system provides 
control of the robotic arms through hand gestures. 
The developed software provides control of the robotic arms, the gripping tools of the robot arm 
through hand gestures, in addition to moving the robot arm itself. Based on the state of the hand, 
the robot's gripping tools can open or close. 
In my paper, I used the ROS (Robot Operating System) libraries for robot control. Additionally, 
I used the Kinect SDK for handling the Kinect camera and the ZMQ protocol for communication 
between the components. The developed system can recognize the user, tracking their 
movements, and fitting them onto a dual-arm industrial robot.

Szasz Nimrod Janos,PointerApp ,"Abstract 
Nowadays,  everyone  has  a  smartphone  that  can  solve  many  problems  with  various 
applications. Such useful applications are, for example, applications for paying our bills, but we 
can also find many applications for managing our day-to-day tasks.  
Mobile applications not only make our everyday lives easier but can also be helpful in 
educational institutions. The most commonly used mobile applications in schools and universities 
are various calculators, translators, and note-taking applications. 
However, applications for presenting PowerPoint presentations are not widespread among 
people, so their number is very small and they are not the best maintained or do not have many 
features that would make the use of these applications meaningful other than that the user does not 
have to keep a separate device with them.  
My thesis aims to design a system that allows laser pointers to be used on PowerPoint 
presentation slides with the help of our smartphone regardless of whether we have an Android or 
IOS phone. In addition, it should allow switching between slides and drawing on them. The system 
consists of two components: one part is the server, which receives and processes data sent by our 
phone; the other part is the phone, which detects the user’s hand movements with the help of the 
accelerometer in the phone and also sends the pressing of displayed buttons to the server via WiFi. 
The data required to connect to the server is made possible by scanning the QR code generated by 
the server.","Mobile application, PowerPoint, laser pointer.","Smartphone applications, Mobile applications, Educational institutions, PowerPoint presentations, System design, ",2023

Kezdi Ors Sebestyen,Datapack creation in Minecraft,"Abstract
Minecraft is a sandbox game with a significant player base. It enjoyed undisputed
popularity since its establishment more than 10 years ago. Minecraft nowadays
is one of the most played games, it joined the ranks of iconic games together
with the likes of Tetris. It also managed to continuously reinvent itself, thus
keeping generations engaged to this day. It is offered on all major platforms in
multiple variations to suit the need of everyone. It can even be considered a viable
educational tool and in recognition of this, an Educational Edition is also provided.
Given the game’s capabilities, one of the major classes of players is the creators.
Creators generally for the entertainment of their fellow players, and their own,
take the keyboard to enrich the community with their unique creations. One of
the many ways to achieve this is to create so-called datapacks. Datapacks offer a
native way of adding new mechanics which offer a way to provide modifications
ranging from quality of life improvements through new challenges all the way
to complete overhauls of the base mechanics of the game. This thesis offers an
overview with practical examples of datapacks, providing a starting point for
the reader to begin their journey in datapacks. One might say that creating a
datapack challenges the mental faculties as much as classical programming and
creativity as much as arts. This thesis describes the evolution of datapacks offering
some context for them and explaining the related game mechanics. The technical
assistance section of the thesis offers some background technical knowledge which
is required to better understand the following sections of the thesis. Following this,
a walkthrough is provided describing the creation of such a datapack in a practical
manner from scratch. This part also demonstrates the original contributions,
implementations and related techniques. Recursion is presented via exponentiation
by squaring. Adding on to this the thesis presents Random Number Generation
and Object-Oriented Programming like handling of variables.","Minecraft, datapack, mcfunction, exponentiation by squaring, randomnumber","Minecraft, Datapacks, Creators, Educational tool, Game mechanics, ",2022
Elekes Rebeka,AlgoRhythmics testing module,"Abstract
ThetopicofmythesisisthefurtherdevelopmentoftheAlgoRhythmicsenvironment,
with a module that allows testing the information obtained within the environment. Since
the AlgoRhythmics environment is also used to develop computational thinking, it is not
only able to test the information about algorithms, but also to test the development of
computational thinking thanks to this module.
In previous research, when measuring students’ performance, separate testing appli-
cations were used, and to do this, the students who participated in the research had to
navigate from the AlgoRhythmics site to another site, register there and then complete
a test consisting of different questions. To this end, the idea of an embeddable module
was born to improve the user experience and to help teachers to simplify testing within
the environment and to make it easier to conduct research.
I felt it was important to create a module that was easy to use and that would
facilitate the work of teachers using the environment. At the same time, an important
criterion was to create a competitive module with all the functionality that was available
in the testing interfaces used so far.
With the completed module, I was also able to create a research in which I tested
the development of computational thinking through metaphors, and this research was the
first to be done with this module, within the environment framework.","quiz, computational thinking, testing, computer science education.","AlgoRhythmics, Testing module, Computational thinking, User experience, Research opportunities, ",2022

a simple or a more advanced website, it will make the development process a lot easier.
In this research we provide a comprehensive overview of JavaScript Frameworks,
next we examine the three most used ones to highlight the advantages and limitations of
each of them. After analyzing the biggest software development portals, the three most
used frameworks today are Angular, React, and Vue. The comparison first was done on

Tasnadi Istvan Norbert,Application of the A* algorithm in video games,"Abstract
Usingcomputersisnowanintegralpartofourlives,andweusethemformanythings,
whether it’s to do our work at work or at home as a recreational tool such as browsing
the web, listening to music, watching a film or even playing games. Video games have
gained immense popularity over the last decade, where people like to sit down and play
a game in their free time, either with friends or against a computer, which is expected
to be as natural and smart as possible, which makes the game more enjoyable, as it can
also provide a challenge to the user, which is why many game development companies
are trying to put more advanced and smarter artificial intelligence into their games.
The aim of my thesis is to create an artificial intelligence for a 2D platformer game
that can entertain and challenge the user with its complex behaviour, making our game
more enjoyable. By complex behaviour of the AI we mean the following: patrol the op-
ponent if it has not noticed the player or if the player has fled, if it has noticed the
player then chase the player or attack the player if it is close enough. To increase the
intelligence of the AI, the A* path search algorithm will play a major role, which will
optimally determine the shortest route between the player and the opponent, where the
opponent will chase the user-controlled character along that route.
To implement the game, the Unity game engine was used, while the A* Pathfinding
Project plugin was loaded to apply the A* pathfinding algorithm.",,"Computers, Video games, Artificial intelligence, Game development, A* pathfinding, ",2022
Gabor Anita Renata,The problem of graph coloring in a genetic approach,"Abstract
The main topic of my dissertation is the use of genetic algorithms to solve a classical
problem. As we know, almost every living thing in the world around us can be traced
to Darwin’s theory of evolution. A similar computer program can be processed for this
process, resulting in the production of different ""individuals"" as genetic processes.
There are situations in life where it is important to get the best results not only ac-
curately but also quickly. In these cases, it can be very important which of the algorithms
available to you to choose to solve the problem.
The focus of my case study is the problem of graph coloring, which is still a very
unknown field in the programming world.
For my research, I am looking for an answer to the question of how worthwhile it is
to use genetic algorithms to got a better solution than a given one. In the meantime, I
have listed several aspects for my proof. Such as what is the difference between a classical
solution and a genetic solution for a given task, or what happens if the initial population
is less than the number of generations we will get is the result or vice versa, or what if I
increase or decrease the number of colors or what will have an effect on the effectiveness
of a good coloring, the number of edges or nodes.
I run the survey on a self-designed software for 100 randomly generated graphs. The
tests are repeated and I calculated averages to make the results even more valid. Finally
I compared and evaluated the results.
By the end of my research, based on the results, we draw conclusions as to why it is
suitable to use a genetic algorithm. We can also delve into the problem of graph coloring.",,"Genetic algorithms, Graph coloring, Evolutionary theory, Optimization, Problem-solving, ",2022
Somai Norbert Attila,Football Lobby: Mobile app for organizing football matches,"Abstract
The aim of my thesis is to make it easier and faster to organize and search for soccer
matches using an android application.
It has happened to many of us that we would have liked to go out to play football in
the afternoon, after school, university, or work, but it takes a lot of time to ask all your
friends if they can and do want to join. Often it is only after a lot of wasted time that it
turns out that you end up failing to gather the right number of players, so unfortunately
the game is missed.
A solution to these problems is provided by the project, which implements a user-
friendlyandefficientAndroidapplicationthatallowsustocreateafootballmatchwaiting
room after registration, with a specified location and time where and when we want to
play. You can add friends to this, search for other players and invite them to join and
play with you. If you don’t want to create your own game, you can search for the right
one for you and join.
Furthermore, the implemented software provides an opportunity to chat with other
users, privately or at room level. After the game is over, we can rate the participating
players according to different criteria. These ratings help us find the right players for our
team. Everyone prefers to play with someone, who has very good ratings and a lot of
positive feedback from previous games, even if we don’t know that person, rather than
someone with bad ratings.
The app also notifies the users of any major events, guaranteeing that it won’t go
unnoticed if someone sends you a message, a friend request, wants to join one of our
lobbies, or we simply need to rate our teammates after a game is over.","organization of soccer matches, lobby, finding players, finding games.","Soccer matches, Android application, Organize, User-friendly, Matchmaking, ",2022
Kovács Andrea,Mouse dynamics-based bot detection,"Abstract
Nowadays bot detection is gaining more and more attention due to the damage caused
by bots besides the fact that they perform automated tasks. Although the presence of
bots is being examined from more and more aspects to prevent attacks, it is a complex
process as state-of-the-art bots are already aimed at mimicking human behavior.
In my research, I examine the human-like behavior of bots in terms of different gener-
ated mouse movements. I generated synthetic data sets based on different parameterized
versions of Bézier curves and also by a generative adversarial network (TimeGAN) spe-
cialized in time series. I performed feature extraction on raw data sets, which resulted in
a total of 29 features.
I had access to the Sapimouse data set, which contains mouse dynamics data for 120
users. Using this data set and the synthetic data sets, I measured the performance of
different detectors. The best performing detector, which proved to be the most suc-
cessful in distinguishing between generated and real human mouse movements was the
LOF, achieving values above 0.81 for 1 mouse movement and above 0.96 for 10 mouse
movements in terms of AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) metric.
The research part was followed by the development of a software that illustrates single
mouse movement-based bot detection.","bot detection, mouse movement, anomaly detector.","Bot detection , Human behavior , Mouse movements , Synthetic data , Feature extraction, ",2022
Demeny Zsofia,Anomaly detection for password typing,"Abstract
These days the security and maintenance of IT systems are very important. To
access these systems’ functionalities, authentication is required. Authentication makes it
possible for users with the appropriate rights to access sensitive data. Authentication can
be performed by biometrics, which means the measurement of characteristics related to
life processes. Authentication systems can be divided into two categories: access-based
authentication and continuous authentication.
In my dissertation, I studied keystroke rhythm in the case of password typing, which
is an authentication method based on behavioral biometrics. Typing rhythm refers to the
speed at which a person writes or types. This characteristics is suitable for identifying
and authenticating a person.
I divided the research into two major parts. Firstly, I examined which is the best
performing anomaly detector in the world of typing rhythms. Here I used the PyOD
package and studied the detectors in it.
The second half of the research was closely related to the first. I studied how I could
compare the performance, and illustrate the results of the measurements made. This is
how the website component was born, which illustrates the measurements, summarizes,
and highlights the important information: it has a teaching, didactic character. All soft-
ware created is publicly available on GitHub.","authentication, behavioral biometrics, typing rhythm.","Authentication, Biometrics, Keystroke rhythm, Behavioral biometrics, Anomaly detector, ",2022
Csegzi Hunor,System to collect and elaborate data in superior education,"Abstract
In my dissertation, I developed a system to collect and elaborate data in superior
education to ensure quality. I started to develop a web application, in which it is possible
to create statements, modify tables containing data, delete, overwrite data, and upload
them in Excel format. The software helps anyone who has access to it, enter data, and
organize transparent data sets from displayed tables.
Priortothedevelopment,Iconsideredseveralalternativesolutions,butinconclusion,
the technology I chose proved to be the most effective. This technology is the RDLC
report, which was initially unknown to me as well, thus I learned and discovered it both
during the development process of my dissertation and during the writing process. The
most important of the many advantages of this solution is the easy editing, which can be
dynamically edited and implemented in XML format, but last but not least it is easier
to implement with the system packages I have chosen.
The development of the system was guided by opinions who has to elaborate data
to create reports. The elaboration of data has been, and will continue to be necessary, so
I kept it important throughout my software development to keep the project sustainable
and functional in the long run with minimal development. I created the system with the
information obtained during the research and taking into account the needs and requests
of the target user, as the most important thing is that the user community accepts it and
is happy to use it. This solid, analytical platform also simplifies the day-to-day tasks of
teachers involved in education, but provides a simple, clean, usable interface during the
years.
With the simplicity and efficiency in mind, I have written my dissertation, the main
functionality of which is the elaboration of reports, embedded in a user interface that
meets the current design conditions, where the competent user can understand the soft-
ware and easily find the desired information to access this function. Thus, the system and
website I have designed and implemented provides a user-friendly environment for both
clients and the designer.","RDLC, elaboration, web","system development, data collection, web application, RDLC report, user-friendly interface.",2022

buildings, constructions that are happening near us. Starting from our home, to the near
streets we are walking every day, to the offices, universities. When we are dealing with
situations like these, we need equipment, construction materials and/or people who work
in constructions.

unused items that are lying in our houses without any purpose. The shops that sold those
items can not take them back, so they can be somehow reused by other people. The other

Szilveszter David,Parameter identification in mathematical modelling using differential equations,"Abstract
Mathematical modelling is essentially a way of describing how our world works, using
a precise, concise, objective language. The complexity of these models stems from the fact
that not only do individuals within a population differ, but also the external influences on
them vary. They can be used for a number of purposes, such as scientific understanding,
quantifyingtheimpactofdifferentchangesonasystem,andcanalsohelptomaketactical
and strategic decisions.
Models can be classified according to different aspects, depending on the number
of populations, they can be single or multi-population models, classical or structural.
To choose the mathematical method, it is important to determine whether the model is
continuous or discrete.
The modelling process can be divided into four different stages: construction, study,
testing and finally use. Problems can arise when moving from one stage to the next, and
it is always necessary to go back to the previous step. In the event of a subsequent change
at any stage, the testing phase must be repeated. Mathematical modelling came to the
fore in population research between 1900 and 1940, mainly in the context of predator-
prey relationships and competition theories. The models still used today are those of A.
J. Lotka, V. Volterra, G.F. Gause and A.J. Nicholson.
In my thesis, I will use three methods to estimate the unknown parameters of the
specified model, including the integral, log integral method, where I will use the Lotka-
Volterra predation model as a leading tool for three species, and finally, I will try to
improve the results by particle swarm optimization. I compare the results with solutions
from an advanced software package incorporating artificial intelligence.","integral method, log integral method, particle swarm optimisation, differen-tial equations, mathematical modelling","Mathematical modelling, Population research, Model classification, Mathematical methods, A.J. Lotka, ",2022
Kovacs Norbert,Officers on the chessboard,"Abstract
Nowadays we meet a lot of logic games in each of the corners of the online space,
which we use with pleasure indifferent from sex and age. Although the young people are
using mostly the logic games, also the middle aged and the old people are playing these
games with pleasure. For example: chess, mill, backgammon, etc. Many want to develop
competitively, but the most of the persons are playing logic games because of pleasure.
The main purpose of the logic games is the developing of the intellectual abilities and the
useful and valuable use of the free time.
My purpose is in this work, to create a kind of software, which contains a logic
game. The base of this logic game is a chess table. The essence of the game is that from
the chess pieces, selected from the gamer, must be put as many as he can on the table
without to hit one each other, in the already known steps, which belongs to the figures.
The size of the chess table and of the figures which are used on this can be chosen from

Timar Mate Adam,Mobile application for shopping canvas paintings,"Abstract
Online shopping is flourishing today, as on one hand a wide range of online plat-
forms, applications and web shops offer users a convenient way to do their shopping, on
the other hand the coronavirus has forced people to do their purchases online. However,
experience shows that the online shopping trend has continued after the epidemic situa-
tion subsided. The focus of my thesis is the online sale and purchase of products, using
a mobile application I have developed, which aims to connect the distributor with the
customers. This application provides an excellent solution for the online purchase of wall
pictures for home decoration purposes, as it satisfies several aspects of the most impor-
tant needs of the customers.
The app is easy to use, but at the same time it offers the users several options that make
it easier for them to select and buy products. After a quick registration, the prospective
customers can browse through the products and, if they find a product that they like,
they can request additional information as well as add it to their shopping cart. The
final list of products from the cart and their price can be viewed and, if everything is all
right, users can finalize the order and, after filling in the address, can expect to receive
the product that will be delivered to them shortly. Registered users can give feedback on
products by rating it or adding a review. This information is visible to everyone, so that
customers can help each other in choosing the right product.
The web shop admin can upload new products - attaching photos for illustrative purposes
-, but even the admin cannot delete or edit the customers’ reviews. This can only be done
by the user who added the review to the certain product, thus ensuring that the reviews
remain authentic and objective. The admin’s main task is to view all orders placed by
customers, including the details required for delivery.

Szakacs David,Web end-to-end testing system,"Abstract
The subject of my thesis is the creation of an application that makes it possible to
test web pages with ease using a graphical interface. The objective is to make it easy for
the users to test the correct behavior of their websites without them having to learn new
testing libraries. The application enables the users to implement end-to-end web tests
in just a few minutes. I managed to implement a product that makes the web testing
process 90% faster and 70% cheaper than the most used products on the market.
The application is built based on a Software-as-a-Service model, so the product is
not the graphical interface itself, but the automated testing system behind it. The sole
purpose of the GUI(Graphical User Interface) is to create a better user experience and
make the application available and usable for a larger audience.
The graphical interface is a desktop application, that is implemented using Electron,
a technology that embeds a website inside a desktop software, which can be installed
and used on Linux, Windows and MacOS. This way we can have a product with a high
cross-platform compatibility and the ability to test local websites at the same time.
The application is communicating with a server, which is responsible for the project
and user data management. This way the users can have the same exact experience from
any device they access the application from.
The server-side application is written in TypeScript using the Express.js framework

Mihaly Bence,Image segmentation with the help of U-net,"Abstract
Nowadays, thanks to the development of machine learning, machine learning is more
frequently used to analyse images. The U-net is such a convolutional neural network
that was primarily developed for accurate image segmentation of biological images. The
success of U-net is demonstrated by its widespread use, ranging from CT and MRI scans
to vehicle detection.
In my thesis I seek answers to the question that which parameters could achieve the
most accurate image segmentation on a given dataset. The accurate image segmentation
might help in all sorts of fields and could potentially save lives, for instance, on a CT
scan, if it can detect and identify an abnormality of a tissue.
During the research, we save models with different kind of parameters to compare
and evaluate the differences between these models. The examined architecture with the
best parameter settings results at least 97% classification accuracy and it is able to detect
parts of the images, so the model provides some really good results.
Since U-net is a new approach to image segmentation, it may be worthwhile to try
several parameter settings that could lead to an even more accurate image segmentation
architecture.","U-net, image segmentation, convolutional neural network.","Machine learning, Image segmentation, U net, Parameters, Accuracy, ",2022

Berszan Robert,Similarity metrics in image recognition,"Abstract
In my thesis I take a closer look at distance-based similarity metrics used in image
recognition by comparing them on different image classification tasks. Nowadays there
is a significant interest towards the research of image recognition techniques, because
they contribute to the development of modern autonomous systems. There are numerous
challenges with a wide range of difficulties facing this technology, but thanks to high
computational power, modern computers can outperform human recognition in terms
of speed and accuracy in certain situations. Recent innovations rely frequently on image
recognition methods, which allowed for the development of technologies such as Advanced
Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), biometric authentication and image-based medical
diagnostic tools.
By taking a picture’s pixel values we can perform mathematical computations and
even measure similarity between two instances by using different kinds of formulas. In
order to quantify the similarity, first, we need to measure a distance. The two images will
be similar, if the distance between them is small enough. Taking this into account, when
working with a labeled dataset, we can classify a new image just by assigning the label
of the most similar image to it. With a high accuracy this can lead to image recognition.
In order to achieve this, there is need for the development of fast, efficient and reliable
algorithms.
InthisworkIamcomparingdifferentdistancemetricsforthecomputationofsimilar-
ities. Alongside the traditional distance measures, such as the Euclidean, the Manhattan
and the Cosine measures, I experiment with the usage of dynamic time warping (DTW)
algorithm on images. In all the cases I will be using a nearest neighbor classifier, which
will handle the classification process of the images, based on the calculated similarities.
The experiments will be carried out on two image datasets: one containing hand-
written digits, and one with human facial expressions. By using a 10-fold cross validation
testing protocol, I will be measuring the run times, the mean and the standard deviation
of recognition accuracies.
I will make conclusions based on the results and highlight the best performing dis-
tance metrics, but I will also demonstrate the hidden potential of using DTW on image
recognition tasks.
Together with my advisor, we also created a scientific poster about this thesis, which
we took to the 13th Dubrovnik Conference on Cognitive Science (DUCOG 2022). Here
I presented the concept of emotion recognition based on images of facial expressions to
the participants, who gave positive feedback regarding the research and the usability of
the technology.","distance, metrics, image recognition, similarity","Image recognition, Distance metrics, Similarity, Nearest neighbor classifier, Dynamic time warping (DTW), ",2022
Nagy Hunor Zalan,Application of machine learning methods for the segmentation of infant brain tissues based on multi-spectral MRI data,"Abstract
Nowadays, in our fast-developing world, more and more medical imaging instruments
are producing an exponentially growing amount of image data. The processing of this
kind of data requires high qualified medical stuff, whose training that would be very
expensiveforthesystem.So,thereisanurgentneedtotrainthecomputerstoperformthe

find the most suitable machine learning algorithm to accurately and efficiently segment
the brain tissues of sixth-month-old infants from volumetric MRI data.
A framework was created, in which seven machine learning methods can be deployed
to process the ten brain MRI records of the iSeg-2017 database. In each case, at the
same time, training is performed using nine records, and tested on the tenth one. The
implemented segmentation methods rely on the OpenCV Machine Learning library. A
graphical user interface was created to set the parameters of each algorithms, which can

can run in parallel mode. For the evaluation of the segmentation’s result, statistical
methods were employed. The framework was written in C# programming language in
Microsoft Visual Studio environment.
From the investigated machine learning algorithms, the best result came from the
discrete AdaBoost, with slightly above 84% of accuracy, which was tightly followed by
Random Forest. In efficiency, the KNN algorithm isn’t competitive, but in case of training
with tiny sized learning data, it can produce similar accuracy to the above mentioned
algorithms.","magnetic resonance imaging, brain tissue segmentation, machine learning,supervised learning, pattern recognition","Medical Imaging Instruments, Machine Learning Algorithm, Brain Tissue Segmentation, MRI Data, AdaBoost, ",2022
Fechita Catalin Francisc,FIND AND REPLACE,"Abstract
The aim of my thesis is to present the Find and Replace tool in a different context,
which eases up the job of a developer/programming student. As we all know, nowadays
every text editor software and development environment has a find & replace tool, but
in almost every cases it is limited to a single opened file or project.
The goal of the software written by me is to make searching and replacing in a large
number of files as fast as possible. Since there are similar applications available, my focus
is not only on making it fast, I also focused on implementing useful functionalities for the
target mentioned above.
In this thesis I present two other similar applications besides mine. I test the main
search and replace methods in each of the applications, and I measure their speed of
execution. I do more than one run on every method, so that I can calculate their average
performance, in order to get authentic results. After the tests, I will compare and evaluate

Tamas Szabolcs Huba,Catalog search extension,"Abstract
The topic of my thesis was to create an extension, the essence of which is to search
for a product number in the ""CATALOG SEARCH"" application, which you can select in
the user’s browser. than what you have chosen.
Of course, this can also be solved by the user memorizing the product code on one
page, then entering the application, entering the number and getting the results. The
problem with this is that it takes a lot more time than the plugin I created.
There are situations in life where it is important that we can solve these things not
only accurately, but as quickly as possible, so the time factor also matters. In my thesis,
this goal was set for me to make the life of the application users easier and to achieve
what they are interested in as quickly as possible. Among the aims of the thesis, the most
important advantages of the extension should be mentioned, in addition, I also covered
the technologies used, I thoroughly analyzed everything, why it is worth using them. To
achieve my goal, I used the internet to gain interesting data.
In this thesis, I am looking for the answer to the question of how to take advantage
of the possibilities offered by extensions, where and how to store user data, why use
localStorage. I used this feature instead of a database through which I could access the
application. Only users who already have an account can use this extension.",,"Extension, Catalog search, Plugin, Time factor, LocalStorage, ",2022
Csép Tamás,Image Processing on Web Interface,"Abstract
Digital image processing has undergone an explosive development in recent decades,
and it has become part of our daily lives, even if it is a concept of the majority of
people nor about the basics of it. Digital image processing tools can be found in medical
diagnostic instruments, space exploration tools, printing technology, phototechnics,
industrial process control as well as electronic gaming machines. So we can safely say
that we use it in all areas of life, so more and more professionals need and will need to
know about computer image processing.
The topic of my dissertation is image processing on a web interface. Image processing
is a method by which we can perform certain operations on an image to obtain an
improved image or extract useful information from it.
I succeeded in implementing an application that allows you to use OpenCV.js
library’s functions through an user interface. During the design of the application, I
made sure that the interface was user-friendly and easy for the user to navigate on it.
Finally, I compared OpenCV’s image processing functions in three different program-
ming languages. The C++, Python, and Java OpenCV libraries have more functions than
the JavaScript OpenCV library.",,"Digital image processing, Application, OpenCV.js library, Image processing functions, User interface, ",2022

Lukacs Krisztina Beata,Tasks and their automatic correction assurance software.,"Abstract
With this thesis I would like to help programmers, especially students, who have
difficulties with programming techniques. „ Practice with Five Techniques” is a local
platform, which contains exercises mainly in Hungarian language and with different pro-
gramming techniques. The user needs to register and log in to both view and select
exercises.
It provides automatic correction of exercises that the user solves, runs with the given
inputs and then sends for correction. A final rating, a score, is the feedback to the user
on the exercises he has solved and is summarised in a table.

Cioma Roland Sandor,Intelligent document browser,"Abstract
The goal of my project is to create an application that makes digitizing documents
easier. Digitization is very prominent and important for the operation of businesses and
institutions.
My application can be used to digitize two kinds of documents: scanned paper doc-
uments, where the user can upload images or .pdf files and sound files. The software
extracts the data from the document during every upload, resulting in a computerized
text file. Before the application saves the data from the document, it extracts the entities
(people, institutions, dates, etc.) from the text. Furthermore, it creates a summary of the
text, which is useful in case someone does not wish to read the entire text. The other
important function of the software is browsing the documents. Users can search for, view
and download documents uploaded by other users.
When creating the software, I have made use of artificial intelligence and integrated
several libraries into the application, all of which contribute to creating a state-of-the-art
software.
The software is made of two parts: an Angular application on the client’s end and
a REST API on the server’s end. This gives it the advantage that it can be further
developed on the client’s end, with a mobile application, for example.",,"Digitization, Application, Documents, Artificial Intelligence, Summary, ",2022
Ivacson Ingrid,The role of the teacher in the online teaching of graph algorithms,"Abstract
The topic of my dissertation is to promote the online teaching of graph algorithms
and to examine the role that the teacher should play in this educational environment. The
2020-2021 school year has made a difference in everyone’s lives. COVID-19 has changed
the way we live our lives. Authorities were forced to introduce decisions that limited our
daily lives. Restrictions have also been introduced in the field of education, which is why
face-to-face education has been replaced by an online educational environment. However,
this has been to the detriment of the academic development of many students.
This period has proved that online education is still in its infancy, so there is a
great need to improve it. This should also be an important goal for the future, as we
may need it again at any time as a result of unforeseen events. At the same time, online
learning has existed in a sense so far and has been favorably used by students. By this
I mean the independent development of the learner by using different phone and web
applications to better understand the curriculum. So the question would be: if there are
online applications that help to acquire and deepen new knowledge, what could be the
real role of the teacher in teaching? Also, how could the benefits of a teacher’s presence
be assessed?
To be able to assess the possibilities, I thought programming teaching would be a
subject that was closer to me and could provide a solution to that. Among programming
techniques, my research is limited to examining the teaching of graph algorithms. The
practical part of my dissertation was the implementation of a web application that en-
ables students to learn and develop independently by acquiring theoretical and practical
knowledge, as well as providing opportunities for teacher-led learning. At the same time,
the site offers an opportunity to evaluate the development of knowledge that the teacher’s
presence will bring to students.
In order to test the application and to search for answers, I conducted surveys among
the first-year students of the university majoring in informatics and computer science,
with a total of four groups. I also tested the effectiveness of the application and the im-
portance of the role of the teacher. I also processed the results statistically and visualized
them using diagrams that provided answers to the questions mentioned above.",,"Online teaching, Graph algorithms, Teacher role, Educational environment, Online applications, ",2022
Majla Nandor,Automatic Time Tracker Using Machine Learning,"Abstract
A Time Tracker is a system and/or software that keeps track of the repeating ac-
tivities the user spends their time with. Many use these for various purposes including
personal improvement and keeping track of billable hours. However, such systems rely on
user input and thus are prone to user errors. Is it possible to implement time-tracking
functionality without user interaction on a personal computer? The goal of this thesis
is to discuss one possible solution to this problem: collecting usage date in a method
similar to that of ""keylogger"" viruses. Using this data, a neural network can be trained
to place time spans spent at the computer into user-defined activity categories. This new
generated data can be the subject of further statistical analysis.",,"Time Tracker, User Input, Billable Hours, User Errors, Neural Network, ",2022

Kovacs Lehel,Solutions for storage tasks using the ERP system and applications,"Abstract
The main topic of my thesis is to help and speed up the solution of warehousing
tasks. Warehousing tasks, such as inventory, handling of outgoing and incoming goods
or even the traceability of goods, are a task that requires a relatively large amount of
time and human resources, which is essential for any company that supplies or distributes
products.
In my present thesis, I am looking for a solution to this problem as generally as
possible, so that the storage needs of as many companies as possible can be provided,
accurate data can be provided and the time allocated for this can be significantly reduced.
ERP systems are designed to solve these types of problems, so by putting these
systems into practice and using a portable device that can communicate with them, the
storage problem can be solved, but the problem of generality still exists. For the sake of
generality, it is necessary that ERP and the portable device that communicates directly
with it do not associate data-specific reports, but this does not benefit companies from
ERP, they also need to report data.
To solve this, a third company-specific component is required that makes sense of the
data provided by the previous components and makes them appropriate for the company.",,"warehousing tasks, ERP systems, portable device, data accuracy, company-specific component",2022
Balogh Laszlo,Mind controlled universal remote control,"Abstract
One often wonders whether it would be nice if some things could happen just by
thinking them. Surprisingly, this technology has been around for a long time and is
constantly evolving. Systems that use this technology are called BCI (Brain-Computer

NextMind has taken a new approach to BCI technology with their 2020 device. Their
technology measures visual field activation, stimulus and decodes focus. The device works
by adding faint graphical overlays optimised for the visual cortex to the user interface
elements, enabling it to be brought into focus. When such an object comes into focus, it
activates and executes the commands assigned to it.

Koble Melinda Andrea,A comparative study on histogram normalization of MRI records,"Abstract
The main drawback of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents the lack of a
standard intensity scale. All observed numerical values are relative and can only be in-
terpreted together with their context. Before feeding MRI data volumes to supervised
learning segmentation procedures, their histograms need to be registered to each other,
in in other words, they need a so-called normalization. The most popular histogram nor-
malization technique used to assist brain MRI segmentation is the algorithm proposed
by Nyúl et al in 2000, which aligns the histograms of a batch of MRI volumes without
paying attention to possible focal lesions that might distort the histogram. Alternately,
some recent works applied histogram normalization based on a simple linear transform,
and reported achieving slightly better accuracy with them. This thesis proposes to inves-
tigate, which of the commonly used histogram normalization methods provides the most
suitable preprocessed brain MRI data for accurate segmentation via machine learning
techniques, and which parameter settings are likely to assure high quality results. Two
publicly available brain MRI data sets are involved in the investigation, one without and
the other with focal lesions. Based on the results obtained via experimental evaluation,
we recommend using the histogram normalization method of Nyúl et al., with no more
than five milestone that represent constraints of the normalized histogram.","magnetic resonance imaging, brain tumor segmentation, brain tissue seg-mentation, histogram, histogram normalization.","Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Histogram normalization, Supervised learning segmentation, Brain MRI, Nyúl et al., ",2022
Pinkoczi Jozsef,OpenGL app for smartphone,"Abstract
The topic of my thesis is to create an application for smartphones based on OpenGL
(Open Graphics Library). OpenGL is a cross-language, cross-platform application pro-
gramming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. The API is typically
used to interact with a graphics processing unit (GPU), to achieve hardware-accelerated
rendering. OpenGL occurs in many places, as it is a popular tool for programmers, as
they can easily draw three-dimensional shapes and control how they are drawn.
Personally, I was also caught up by OpenGL because I wanted to implement an app
that develops kids’ math skills so that it would be a memorable experience for them.
Knowing these, I came to the conclusion that I would use virtual reality to create a game
that would develop the math skills of the first and second graders.
In today’s world, there is a strong emphasis on modernization to make a certain
thing as simple, enjoyable, and fast as possible.
In this thesis, I will briefly present the Unity programming platform, the google

Hamza Balazs,SapiNotes,"Abstract
In today’s world, access to information is much simpler, than it was before. Instead
of spending hours in the library extracting information out of books, we can now

the user needs to enter the major and subject of the note, in addition, a descriptive name,
and last but not least the note itself has to be uploaded. Then with one click, the user
can upload the note to the database, after which it will be displayed on the main page
of the web application. These notes also have a rating, which lets the users rate each

Fuzi Botond,WorkGuru: Time-tracking app for group projects,"Abstract
The topic of my thesis is time management of group projects and increasing the
efficiency of development work using a phone application.
In real life, many people struggle with time management problems, both at work
and in their personal lives. Constant procrastination at work, difficulties in dealing with
unexpected situations or delays due to dependencies during group work. In such cases we
tend to spend more time on solving a problem rather than involving other points of view
or more experienced people. Unfortunately, it is not possible to come up with a universal
template to solve all these types of problems, but in many cases we end up making the
same mistake over and over again. In general, the trinity of orderliness, good scheduling
and good communication is the key to solving the problems mentioned above.
Within the scope of this project, a user-friendly and efficient android application
will be implemented that will help to organize tasks, measure work performance and
collaborate with colleagues within a work team. By measuring the time spent on tasks
in a specific way, the application is able to set up a profile that speeds up the process
of unblocking tasks by giving users the possibility to perform a targeted search to find
the person best suited to perform the task. A platform that puts more emphasis than its
predecessors on maintaining focus and the well-being of users at work.
The implemented application allows logged-in users to create categories, projects
and tasks within a secure system, time them and generate and view reports. The aim
is primarily to assist the user’s work, not to monitor it. Their skills are also measured
during the timekeeping process so that the accumulated experience is quantified to some
extent. This gives credit to the accumulated experience base that the user has gathered
during his measured work. In addition, the pomodoro technique has been introduced for
time measurement, which also contributes to the user’s productivity.","time-tracking, project management, pomodoro.","Time management, Group projects, Efficiency, Development work, Phone application, ",2022

Toth Adam,Task Management Tool,"Abstract
The topic of my dissertation is to solve a problem of the fast developing humanity
with the help of technology. As we know, almost everyone in the world around us already
needs daily pre-programming of what they need to do in order to get everything done
and show up on time at every important meeting. The problem of forward planning is
due to the fact that our world is changing at a rapid pace, accelerating, and we need to
find a solution to see how successfully we are able to perform our daily pre-planned tasks
optimally.
We have reached a level where it is important in the life of an average person to
examine how effectively they perform their tasks, to what extent they are able to perform
them, and whether they succeed in time. There may even be a situation where, in the
knowledge of two tasks being planned very close in time one near the other and the person
may not be able to be complete or show up on time, the logical decision to do so is to
decide on the basis of importance and priority, which one of the two tasks the person
show up for and which task he will perform,finish in time. An appropriate software that
can take the priority into account can also help in this case.
In this dissertation, I am looking for a solution to the problem of what type of
software should be implemented so that a given person can monitor the effectiveness
of managing and planing your day-to-day tasks in order to be able to develop himself
further in being more productive. I divided the software into two categories and so I
will examine: software that already exists and can be used for task planning, and self-
implemented software.
In order to examine the existing software, I conducted a market research in order to
to gather information or find missing functionalities in existing and used software, which I
can integrate into my own software. My own solution consists of two software, an android

Kedves Norbert,Quiz empire,"Abstract
Nowadays, various quiz applications are becoming more and more widespread on the
Internet. A quiz is a series of questions on a specific topic and form that people should try

main purpose is to transfer information and deepen knowledge. In many cases, the only
way to take part in quizzes is to join other activities. In addition, most of the topics are
not well separated or precisely defined. Furthermore, it is a common confounding factor
that the correct answers are not shown, and if the questions that appear during the quiz
are always the same, in the same order.
In my thesis, a quiz-focused software was implemented which provides a solution to
the problems described. It matters a lot for people who would often and willingly take
quizzes to do so in a friendly, unified, and simple interface where the community they
create will help and support each other. To implement the interface, I created a web
application with basic features that are useful, clear and easy to manage.
In the implemented application, users can not only try out existing quizzes which
assess knowledge, but also expand this list by making new quizzes on their own topic.
It often happens that a quiz with the preferred theme is not found anywhere. In this
case, using the ""Requests"" feature will allow people to request a quiz on the topic they
want and the other users can accomplish it in the near future. After finishing a quiz, it
is possible to view our results in more detail in a PDF document, which will help us to
memorize new information. Members can communicate with each other in many ways
(forum, chat, private message), make friends, and see the opinions and the results of the
quizzes.","web application, quiz, topic, result, communication","Quiz applications, Knowledge transfer, Interactive interface, Community support, User-generated quizzes, ",2022
Moldovan Adrienn,NyiltnApp: Software for Organizing Open Days,"Abstract
The subject of my thesis is Open days, a software that eases the organisation of Open
days event series, implemented as a web application which requires authentication.
When organising events, we often need different tools, software, that allow us to store
data entered by users in databases, through a user-friendly visual interface. The purpose
of these applications is to reduce preparation time, to make the work of organisers easier
and also to allow those who want to participate on an event to easily communicate their
intention to do so, to be able to choose among the many events displayed and to find out
details about them.
The project aims to develop software facilitating the organisation of Open days at
the university. In addition, it will be possible not only to collect applications, but also to
summarise them and visualise the data received according to various criteria.
The implemented software allows connected users to view the events taking place
during open days, their dates, locations and organisers, as well as to register and un-
subscribe from them. For administrator users, it is possible to add events, together with
relevant details, as well as edit and delete them.","event, open days, web application, spring boot.","Open days, Software, Organisation, Web application, Authentication, ",2022
Csegezi Balazs Csongor,Interactive Rubik’s Cube solving web application,"Abstract
The topic of my dissertation is an interactive web application that allows its user to
solve the “magic cube”, better known as the Rubik’s Cube. Within the framework of the
application, we have the opportunity to scan the configuration of each side of our cube,
using our webcam, to generate a series of rotations to solve the cube and illustrate it step
by step with a 3D representation for the client.
One of the most popular logic games today, the Hungarian invention, which has been
extremely successful worldwide since the 1980s, is a three-dimensional logic game. The
goal is simple, but all the more challenging: to bring the cube to its original state after
random shuffling, which has long been considered impossible.
Which one solution we choose depends entirely on what level we are at, how many
algorithms we want to keep in mind, how fast we want to solve it, or whether we want
to solve the cube blindly or with one hand? The algorithm built into the application
successfully completes the task with 22 or even fewer rotations, solving all sides of the
cube thanks to Herbert Kociemba’s two-phase algorithm.",,"Interactive web application, Rubik's Cube, Webcam scanning, 3D representation, Logic game, ",2022
Köllő Zsolt,Microservice-based time tracker,"Abstract
Nowadays, cloud services are one of the most common IT services. It can be observed
that various international IT companies strive to release their own cloud services, be it
a hosting service, a database service or even a virtual server. The great advantage of
these services is that the cloud hides from developers the infrastructure necessary for the
operation of a particular system, thereby taking over responsibility from the developers.
However, its advantages also include the fact that the user can keep their data safe and
can access it from anywhere.
The AZORA system, presented in this work, is an application that allows employees of
a particular company to record the time spent on each project and task and to provide
administrative staff with a complete and comprehensive picture of the activity within
that organization. The system is based on a microservice architecture, from which the
present work focuses on the implementation of the service responsible for the registration
of hours.
The app is fully powered by Microsoft Azure cloud services. This assumes that the
application is serverless by which the cloud provider automatically deploys, scales, and
manages the infrastructure required to run the code.","microservice achitecture, cloud, Azure, serverless, time tracker","Cloud services, AZORA system, Microsoft Azure, microservice architecture, serverless.",2022
Berkeczi Arnold,AUTOMATIC SEGMENTATION  OF BRAIN TISSUES FROM  VOLUMETRIC MULTI-SPECTRAL MRI DATA   ,"Abstract 
Nowadays medical image processing is a dynamically evolving science and industry. The 
rapid development of computers makes it possible to implement increasingly complex 
procedures. However, it is also possible for the computer to trigger the more tedious part of a 
human expert’s work and enable the doctor to focus only on cases where the computer has 
found something abnormal or suspicious. With this thesis, I also want to follow this trend. I 
propose to implement a machine learning procedure that can efficiently and accurately 
segment brain tissues based on MRI scans of six-month-old infants. 
During the implementation, I worked with the data published at the iSeg-2017 competition. 
From the OpenCV machine learning library, I found the discrete AdaBoost classifier to be the 
most suitable for segmentation, and I added a post-processing to improve the results of the 
classifier. In addition, I implemented software with a graphical user interface that can be used 
to launch segmentation tasks, visualize the results, and manage the inventory of performed 
operations. The average accuracy of the implemented segmentation procedure was slightly 
above 85%.

Györfi Endre,A P I A A P P - Mobile application to manage  farmers' subsidies. ,"Abstract
Romania receives a large amount of money from the European Union to support farmers involved
in agri-environmental and agricultural production. The brainchild of the project is the Milvus associa-
3
tion , which is involved in nature conservation research. They have observed that farmers have a big
problem in obtaining information on subsidies, as there is currently no single website or application in
Romania that collects subsidies and related information. To solve this problem, the APIA APP project
was created, which consists of an Android application and a content management system.
The aim of the application is to help local farmers to browse the subsidies available in Romania
and to comply with the conditions attached to the subsidies. It also helps to follow the conditions of
the subsidies already won. It helps farmers to win a grant by collecting the documents needed to win
each grant. The development was done in Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile, which supports multiplatform
application development, the Android part was written in Kotlin.
The thesis describes the client and server application, the technologies used for its implementation,
covering the architecture and the functionalities.
Two persons participated in the development of the application, namely Endre Györfi and István-
Lehel Balázs. The development has been divided according to functionalities, which can be followed
in detail in the use-case diagram presented in the thesis.

Mihaly Elod,Optimization of brain tumor  segmentation based on MRI data using an intelligent post-processing   ,"Abstract 
Nowadays, imaging devices deployed in medical clinical practice are producing more and more 
imaging. Processing this data would require an ever-increasing number of human professionals. 
As human resource training is a slow and costly process, there is an increasing need to create 
an algorithm base that processes the daily acquired imagery in reliable quality and brings up to 
the physician only images in which a lesion is detected or suspected to be significant.  
 The present thesis also aims to contribute to this algorithm base with a solution that 
allows to improve the accuracy of tumor segmentation from brain MRI images. Instead of the 
morphological post-processing step of an existing brain tumor segmentation procedure, an 
intelligent algorithm is proposed that achieves its goal using a random forest classifier. 
 Experimental results have shown that the proposed method makes post-processing 18% 
more accurate by replacing the original morphological post-processing with intelligent post-
processing, which reclassifies pixels based on ten morphological features extracted from planar 
and spatial neighborhoods, thus making the final segmentation result more accurate.

Abstract
The paper is about a web application that provides a solution for companies in the
complex task of inventory management.
Nowadays, for every kind of task, there is an object or tool that helps to perform this
task, thus simplifying people's lives. The use of objects, tools has also become common
within companies, as it has allowed them to increase productivity. Because of the many
objects used, keeping track of them has become an increasing challenge for companies.
Due to the virus situation, a large number of companies have given employees the
opportunity to work remotely .
To address these problems, I have created a web application that allows companies to
easily keep track of which objects are in the possession of an employee. The application
should be available to users in multiple roles. The administrator, who is responsible for the
application, whose job is to manage objects, users and user requests. Users are the employees
who can view the objects and request the tools they need. These requests can be accepted or
rejected by the administrators.
Thanks to the web application , it is easy to access and does not need to be configured
for each employee. All you need to access it is the Internet and a web browser.","web application, inventory management, layered architecture7","Inventory management, Web application, Remote work, Productivity, User roles, ",2022
Madaras Ervin,Recunoașterea automată a plăcilor PAL,"Abstract
The project aims to develop software for a wood processing company that can recognise
PAL boards by identifying and comparing different properties. This software will help the
operator of an automated crane to avoid cases where, due to human error, the supplier sends the
wrong type of PAL plate, or where, due to the same error, the woodworking company has
ordered the wrong type of PAL plate. These mistakes can lead to PAL boards, because of a
different type than the one set for the automated crane, being sent to the wrong place in the
warehouse or even the wrong type of board being processed.
The wood processing plant provided data with images of the PAL plates, and from this,
two classification algorithms were implemented. Since only one image sample of each PAL plate
exists in the database, traditional classifiers based on artificial intelligence cannot be used. For
this reason, the two algorithms that have been implemented extract features from each image and
use these features to compare the input sample with the images in the database for comparison.
One of these methods, which has been implemented, determines the dominant colors of
the images by clustering. By comparing dominant colors, the algorithm is able to determine how
similar two images are to each other. By calculating the Euclidean distance between the
dominant colors, it can give a value for how different the two images are from each other,
obviously the smaller the distance, the more similar the images are.
Another method that has been implemented is to split the images into segments and then
compute a histogram for each segment. These histograms are then concatenated to create a
feature vector for the images. It then compares the feature vectors using chi-square distance.
The conclusions are that the algorithms are sensitive to rotation. However, nice results
will be obtained if a segment of the images is created, or only one dominant color is selected and
compared.","dominant color, histogram, classification, similarity measure","PAL boards, Wood processing company, Software development, Classification algorithms, Feature extraction, ",2022

The primary aim of the dissertation is to study the electrical activity of the brain, namely 
the EEG-type signals and to automatically recognize specific emotions. This requires sampled 
data collection and I used “Muse 2” headband in order to sample and collect this data. It was 
asked a woman and a man for the data collection and both of them made the same experiment. 
I processed the raw data, then I used it to build and teach an artificial neural network, which 
was created with the help of Tensorflow and Keras frameworks. 
 The secondary aim of the dissertation is to examine the spectrum of the samples and 
apply different transformations, then to compare them. Based on previous research I examined 
the processing of continuous and discrete signals and placed more emphasis on discrete 
transformations. 
 Based on my results (70-80% recognition efficiency), in order for the neural network 
to be as accurate as possible, it is necessary to collect more data, classify them into classes by 
providing them in a more optimal way. To reach this goal, in the future I would like to develop 
a set of rules from the collected data and to classify my data based on these rules, and so I hope 
to achieve greater recognition efficiency.","EEG, spectrogram, signal processing, Tensorflow, neural networks.","EEG signals, Emotion recognition, Muse 2 headband, Neural network, Recognition efficiency, ",2022

Abstract
Today, smartphones make most of our lives easier, as they allow us to access
services that embrace our day-to-day operations. These services are available through
a downloadable application, a website created by a specialized company. In many
cases, software can save energy and time. The need to manage time can also be
observed in the case of services that put our health and well-being first.
As part of my dissertation, I am developing a software that provides health
services. Important information is that the software is actually on-demand, serving a
Client. The Client's job is to advise on diet, to work as a dietitian in which she can use
the software. The implemented application, which allows the monitoring of clients,
the creation of recipes and diets, was created with the help of Flutter. We use the
real-time database provided by Firebase to store the data. The application is also
available to patients, where they can follow their diet, monitor their changes in body
size, and schedule appointments with their dietitian. The primary basis of the software
was to minimize the number of applications required to be used in the work of a
dietitian. Similar applications have been observed, as well as different parameters that
need to be considered when developing a medical application.
The Client also took part in the complete development of the software, and her
comments and needs were taken into account. The application is a version of the
expected software, for which there are still some development ideas, but for now, it
fully covers the main functionalities.","medical application development, dietitian, patient, flutter9","Smartphones, Software, Health services, Dietitian, Flutter, ",2022

Abstract 
The world is moving fast towards digitalization by taking huge steps in all areas of life and thus 
almost every person has now a smartphone. Nowadays, there are plenty of applications to facilitate 
our everyday tasks, however, in one of the most important areas, education, we still do not take 
advantage of the opportunities offered by these tools. 
The goal of my dissertation is to provide an alternative to the handwritten catalogue used in public 
education that makes it easy for all teachers, students, and parents to track student marks and 
absences and helps optimizing administration processes. A teacher can hold the catalogue of all 
the classes he teaches in his hand at the same time and note their grades at any time, as the physical 
limit, given by the fact that there is only one unique piece for each class, is eliminated. The students 
will also have the opportunity to view their marks and absences at any time without interrupting 
the classes and parents will be able to keep track of real data through their kid’s user as well. 
To implement this solution, I created a multiplatform application that is compatible with 
smartphones running iOS and Android, but also any device that has a web browser.

Deák Adrienndokum,Remote control of industrial robots with Android application,"Abstract
Nowadays, IoT (Internet Of Things) technology-based systems are gaining more ground,
enabling the efficient remote control, monitoring, and management of industrial processes

Industrial robots have their own control devices to program and monitor, but these tools
are usually immovable. Therefore, in addition to these devices, mobile phone applications
can effectively serve as an extension.
This work aims to develop an open-source Android application that can be used to
remotely control robots used in the industry. The developed application can monitor
the motion of the robot based on video and sensor informations, it can send commands

In recent years, there has been a rapid increase in demand for vehicles equipped with
GPS. As it becomes an increasing priority for people to get from one point to another as
smoothly as possible, it can be beneficial to be able to filter out the busier road sections. It can be
helpful for the vehicle owner to know as much retrievable information about the vehicle as
possible based on the route taken.
The aim of the dissertation is to process the routes of the vehicles in such a way that
conclusions can be drawn from them, with the help of which relevant data (average speed, curve
coordinates) can be filtered out. The available data set is made up of different data (coordinate,
speed, consumption, direction). The developed algorithm can be used to reduce the data set
without losing statistically important data.
The most important data contains the coordinates that result in a route change. The
solution is able to detect bends from which it can generate significant statistics (average speed in
a curve). As a result, it is able to compare different routes and suggest new ones.

 Nowadays, geopositioning can be done on even the smallest devices, such as a smart 
watch or a smart phone. Each of the GPS applications uses the reverse geocoding feature of the 
map application to give the user accurate information about their location. To be able to do this, 
the map application must be backed by a serious database that stores geographic data for millions 
of points around the world. 
There are many applications that can provide very accurate map data to users. The most known 
applications are Google Maps, Bing Maps, Apple Maps, and the open source OpenStreetMap. 
One of the great advantages of OpenStreetMap is that it is open source, but it is also one of it’s 
weaknesses, because being open source, anyone can update the data in its database. 
OpenStreetMap allows for local installation through software called Nominatim, this means that 
companies can become independent from big companies who provide Map APIs for huge 
amount of money. Installing such a server requires a huge amount of disk space, and the amount 
of data continues to grow after installation due to updates. 
The aim of this dissertation is to develop a software system that allows the Nominatim 
web server data to be updated automatically, but also allows the user to manage the update 
process. The software system consists of two main components, a web application that tests the 
data. A server collection that allows you to update the data in the database. The web application 
is an ASP.NET Core application implemented with an MVC architectural pattern. This testing 
application allows the user to test the differences between two Nominatim servers. The server

The topic of my thesis is the presentation of a web application that makes it easier
to manage the days off of employees within a company. In a larger company, as the
number of employees increases, it becomes more and more difficult for the management
to handle the allocation of days off. At the same time, employees also face difficulties in
the application process, which is not the same for all workplaces and may even vary from
time to time within a company. The application aims to overcome these problems.
To achieve this goal, I decided to create a web application. One of the main aspects
of the application is to make everyone’s job easier, so it should also be easy to access,
without having to go through the installation process on each device separately. At the
same time, the development does not have to take into account the specific requirements
of different operating systems. All you need is a device that can connect to the Internet
and has a browser.

Felmeri Zsolt,Keylogger,"Abstract
The aim of my thesis is the implementation of a software-based keylogger which has
more functionalities than an avrage keylogger. Worldwide there is at least one computer
or machine running an operating system in almost every building, as we know. Therefor,
care must be taken in order not to be a victim of a virtual attack.
After we entered the world of the Internet, there is a growing threat from malware.
Therefore, I tried to develop a software-based keylogger from the persppective of an
attacker, i.e hacker. However, I was not only interested in the perspective of an attacker,
but I also wanted how I can prevent them. So anti-virus programs prevent keyloggers
from being installed on systems. During my research, I noticed that keyloggers are also
used in companies to monitor their computer systems.
During planning, the project had to be divided into two parts. So two softwares had
to be designed: one will run on the hacker’s side and monitor the victim’s keystrokes and
the other one ill be installed on the victim’s operating system. The victim side sends the
data and the hacker side receives it. The data travels over the network, so it is a good
idea to encrypt the packets. For example, with well-monitored system packets traveling
on the network can be tracked. The purpose of encryption is to prevent anyone from
interpeting the content of a package.
I used common operating systems for testing, both on virtual machines and real

Gergely Zsolt,User authentication based on PIN code typing dynamics,"Abstract
In information systems, the access to services are mostly based on authentication to
protect the system and user information. In authentication systems, we distinguish two
main types: entry-based and continuous authentication systems. Based on the reliability
of the authentication system both types can be divided into primary and secondary
methods.
In my research, I examine a secondary authentication system based on behavioral
biometrics: authentication based on PIN-code typing dynamics. This system assumes
primarily the knowledge of the PIN-code while secondarily it checks its typing rhythm.
The typing rhythm as a behavioral biometrics is a long-researched area, however very few
researches have been conducted in connection to PIN-code typing rhythms. Initially, such
systems used 4 digit-PIN codes for authentication, today the use of 6 digit PIN-codes is
getting popular.
In the first part of my research, I created a data collector application that collects the
typing information from the users with the help of a software keyboard. With the help of
the software, we collected 20 typing samples of 6 digit PIN-codes from 112 people. I tried
several anomaly detectors, but the best results were provided by the scaled Manhattan
detector: 0.126 equal error rate (EER) and 0.925 area under the curve (AUC).
In the second part of my research, I incorporated the developed method into an An-
droid software component that any application running on Android phone can simply use
by specifying dependencies. Both the data collector and the Android software component
source codes are publicly available on GitHub.","authentication, behavioral biometrics, typing rhythm, PIN-code.","Authentication systems, Behavioral biometrics, PIN code typing dynamics, Anomaly detectors, Android software component, ",2021
Molnár Balázs,Web application for analyzing and evaluating programming competition tasks,"Abstract
The topic of my dissertation is a web application that helps to analyze and evaluate
programmer competition tasks. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we faced a number of
problemstobesolvedinalmosteveryareaoflife.Theeducationsystemhadtogothrough
enormous changes in order to be able to pass on the right level and quality of knowledge
to future generations.
In my dissertation I tried to find a solution to such a problem. The source of the
problem is not new, it has been felt so far in the teaching of Hungarian language pro-
gramming. Students usually do not receive adequate feedback on the tasks they have
prepared and submitted, only a certain score, depending on the correctness of the solved
tasks. Furthermore, so far there has been no online collection of tasks in Hungarian that
provides help to those who do not have adequate foreign language skills.
This is how I came up with the idea to create a web-based application that is easy
to access and use for anyone with internet access. The system is simple yet efficient,
with many expansion options, and can be easily adapted to the needs of teachers and
students.Bothstudentsandteacherscanregisterfortheapp.Eachstudentcanjoinaclass
created by their teacher and then complete dozens of assignments created or uploaded
by either their own teacher or other teachers. The solutions developed and uploaded by
the student can be easily evaluated by the lead teacher and their effective development
can be promoted with his suggestions.
Althoughitwasverydifficulttostart,IampleasedtoknowthatIfinallyachievedmy
primary goals to create a web application suitable for solving and evaluating competition-
level tasks. Nevertheless, I had to realize that this was a huge project, with many oppor-
tunities for improvement that could be worked on for years. This was also proven when
I found a number of applications that were similar in purpose to mine in my search for
preexisting web applications.","web application, education, communication, teacher presence, efficiency.","Web application, Programmer competition tasks, Feedback, Hungarian language programming, Online collection, ",2021
Bako Lorand,Eigenface method used as an access control system,"Abstract
The topic of my thesis consists of the use of the eigenface method, which is an
important part of the principal component analysis (PCA). The face is one of the most
important characteristics of the human body. Usually, by examining the human face,
people can decide if a person is known or unknown to them. Recently, thanks to the
development of technology and the world, people meet hundreds of human faces daily.
With the knowledge of this fact, the question of whether there is a way in which the
properties of the human face can be used in the virtual world arises.
In studying the human face, significant aspects are the determination of different
organs’ position and the determination of the specific characteristics (ex. birthmark).
The analysis and the knowledge of these elements help a lot in people’s identification
both in the real and the virtual life. People daily meet with a big amount of information
and the human life is getting much more dependent on the elements of the virtual world.
Thanks to these things, the identification of people and the access to different places to
be done by using the properties of the human face was just a matter of time.
In this thesis I will attempt to answer the question of whether the eigenface method
deserves to be used as a part of a two-factor authentication (2FA) or not. The method
will be used as the system’s first security factor, which consists of the detection of human
face and of the recognition of a specific person. During the implementation, the main
goal will be to make face recognition more efficient and precise.
Based on the results, I will conclude if the technology used in my research is worth
to be used and, based on my own results, if it is possible for the created system to be
developed in a certain way.","face, eigenface, access control system.","Eigenface method, Principal component analysis (PCA), Human face characteristics, Face recognition technology, Two factor authentication (2FA), ",2021

Csegzi Hunor,System to collect and elaborate data in superior education,"Abstract
In my dissertation, I developed a system to collect and elaborate data in superior
education to ensure quality. I started to develop a web application, in which it is possible
to create statements, modify tables containing data, delete, overwrite data, and upload
them in Excel format. The software helps anyone who has access to it, enter data, and
organize transparent data sets from displayed tables.
Priortothedevelopment,Iconsideredseveralalternativesolutions,butinconclusion,
the technology I chose proved to be the most effective. This technology is the RDLC
report, which was initially unknown to me as well, thus I learned and discovered it both
during the development process of my dissertation and during the writing process. The
most important of the many advantages of this solution is the easy editing, which can be
dynamically edited and implemented in XML format, but last but not least it is easier
to implement with the system packages I have chosen.
The development of the system was guided by opinions who has to elaborate data
to create reports. The elaboration of data has been, and will continue to be necessary, so
I kept it important throughout my software development to keep the project sustainable
and functional in the long run with minimal development. I created the system with the
information obtained during the research and taking into account the needs and requests
of the target user, as the most important thing is that the user community accepts it and
is happy to use it. This solid, analytical platform also simplifies the day-to-day tasks of
teachers involved in education, but provides a simple, clean, usable interface during the
years.
With the simplicity and efficiency in mind, I have written my dissertation, the main
functionality of which is the elaboration of reports, embedded in a user interface that
meets the current design conditions, where the competent user can understand the soft-
ware and easily find the desired information to access this function. Thus, the system and
website I have designed and implemented provides a user-friendly environment for both
clients and the designer.","RDLC, elaboration, web","System development, Educational data, RDLC report, User interface, Data elaboration, ",2021
Ballai Attila,Analysis and synthesis of mouse dynamics,"Abstract
The topic of my thesis is the analysis and synthesis of mouse dynamics applying
different methods, and besides that, mouse dynamics based bot detection. Several bot
detection systems are known using different methods to distinguish humans from bots
based on website usage data.
Most websites use some image or audio recognition techniques or character recog-
nition to distinguish humans from bots. This is because there is no system yet which is
able to detect bots exclusively by mouse movements. Although, this is a widely interested
topic because with such a system there will be no need anymore to recognize image or au-
dio nor any cookie checking like how Google bot detection works, just a simple checkbox
click would be enough.
So in this thesis I would like to analyze mouse dynamics performed by users inside
a web application, I will illustrate them, examine what kind of features could I extract
from them to classify users more precisely. Then, try some method to generate synthetic
mouse movement data set similar to humans in order to deceive bot detectors.
Based on user classification results we can conclude that user recognition based
on mouse dynamics has a low accuracy. However, using features related to the screen

Szabo Albert Balazs,Recycling and Packaging Symbols Recognition Using Machine Learning,"Abstract
One of the urging problems of today’s society is the proper reuse of products. The
79 percent of plastic waste is stored in landfills or dumped into oceans, 12 percent is
incinerated and only 9 percent is recycled. Inadequate storage and improper, ineffective
recycling of products can cause enormous damage. Every year, more than a hundred
million marine organisms die as a result of pollution from plastic waste.
Selective waste collection can be facilitated by the automatic recognition of envi-
ronmental product labels on waste. The recognized symbols together with educational
information, can provide sufficient knowledge for users to make the process of selective
waste collection more efficient and easier.
The current thesis is part of the Greensy project focusing entirely on the problem
of automatic recognition of recyclable symbols, which it solves using various machine
learning methods, with a corpus designed for this purpose. By creating a data set, it
is possible to recognize environmental product labels from a different approach than
attempts in the literature so far.","environmental product labels, computer vision, convolutional neural net-works, data set","recycling, plastic waste, marine organisms, machine learning, environmental product labels",2021
Marton Szilard,Improving Home Security With Artiﬁcial Intelligence,"Abstract
Personal safety is playing an increasingly important role everyday, as a result of which
the topic of my dissertation was the recognition of violence in homes using camera foo-
tages.
Theestablishedsystemdetectsdangerousandviolentscenesusingitsbuilt-inartiﬁcial
intelligence module and then notiﬁes the appropriate person.
Besides that the system perform space surveillance and intrusion control, in addition
it’s scanning for violence detection. This module takes the use of surveillance cameras to
a new level, so if abnormal events occur, it will notify the user as quickly as possible so
that it can react quickly to adverse events. The notiﬁcation process is the top priority,
as it notiﬁes the user of events because the system has been designed to notify the
user only if there is actually a problem. For the implementation and operation of these
functionalities, the android phone application provides a suitable environment.
We will use artiﬁcial intelligence methods to examine what is happening in a variety
of ways, including, as a result of sound and image-based evaluations, to determine what is
happening on the camera and then calculate the hazard factor. Four artiﬁcial intelligence
modules work in the background through a REST API, which is closely connected to a
TCP server, which is also responsible for managing the connected users and processing
the recordings of the cameras belonging to the users. A third component of the system
is the client application already mentioned above, which provides the ability to track
cameras and receive alarm notiﬁcations.","violence, face, sound, motion detection, artiﬁcial intelligence.","personal safety, violence recognition, camera footage, artificial intelligence, surveillance cameras",2021
Kovacs Attila,Comparison of stores and store chains by basket value,"Abstract
The topic of my research paper is the comparison of stores and chain stores by cart
value. In this sped up and modern world, there is no time to read catalogs and brochures
to compare the prices. The problem is that there is a huge variance for the same shopping
cart between stores or chain stores. At the same time, there is a huge need to solve this
problem,becauseevenifpeopledonothavethesameamountofmoney,timeistickingthe
same way for everyone and it is just as important for everybody. The thematic concept is
also justified by my personal experience. As a college boarding student, it was important
to pay attention for what price and where I bought the same products. Also the ecological
footprint of the aforementioned catalogs and brochures is not negligible too.
The aim of my project is to create a system that allows us to get quotes from different
stores and chain stores sorted by location and cart value (top priorities when it comes to
shopping) by simply assembling our shopping cart (which we would have to put together
anyway). We will do the shopping from all the stores and chain stores in the country
and then we will buy the selected products in the store or chain store that has the best
results for us. The project architecturally consists of three main parts: a server (which
serves the website and the android application), a website (for stores and store chains),
and an android application (for end users). The goal is to build a modern system that
meets today’s standards and provides users with a convenient, user-friendly and last but
not least, beautiful and clear interface.
In order to illustrate the problem and the solution provided for it, I created the
server and the android application, in which I will present the operation of the system
from the side of the server and client.

Incze Levente,Problem providing and automatic correction software,"Abstract
The goal of the Kóditt platform is to offer exercises for the high schoolers, and first
year university students, whom would like to acquire the basics of software engineering.
At the same time its second goal is to help the improvement and the algorithmic thinking
of the students, whom are passing the difficulty levels of the occurring exercises and
to deepen their competence. In the XXI. century a student, who is a beginner software
engineer, is faced with the fact, that if he wants to learn the basics of software engineering
in an autodidact way and needs to decide, which programming language to choose the
first thing that needs to be done is looking for those websites, which can help them in a
theoretic and practical way. In most cases, if you want to reach these sites in Hungarian,
you will not really get any results. This is also sustained by the evaluation of the answers
to the pre-test questions, which confirmed my decision: it may be useful to create a
platform that can ensure the verification and correctness of a code written in several
programming languages. An added benefit of this platform may be that the requirements
of the tasks are formulated in Hungarian.
As the saying goes, “even Rome was not built in a day” so theKóditt platform is set
off on the road to the final destination with small steps. Currently, the Kóditt platform
seeks to guide students from simple tasks to complex ones using the C ++ programming
language.
The use foreign languages on these kinds of platforms takes me back to my high
school memories, reminding me of the many difficulties I had to deal with when I came
across the phrasing of the tasks of software engineering and math in a foreign language.

assistant service provider for Sapientia University’s teachers, students and employees
which can communicate in Hungarian. In today’s world everything relies on technology,
there is no other way to choose virtual assistants. Nowadays, everyone has a virtual
assistant on their mobile device. All of these virtual assistants have one thing in common:
they mostly know English.
There are situations in life where a general virtual assistant is not enough. Even if
we were satisfied that it could speak Hungarian, it would not be able to answer all our
questions. For example, asking Cortana, Siri, or the Google Assistant, ""What is the email
address of Sapientia’s Secretary?"", we would get some of the following answers: ""Sorry, I
couldn’t understand."", ""These are the matches for Sapientia on the internet: «insert link
here»"", ""Would you like me to search for secretary?"". All possible answers would either be
about not understanding or searching for the keywords. Searching for the keywords would

Dávid Tamás,Ant colony algorithm and its types,"Abstract
The topic of my thesis is the investigation and comparison of the Ant Colony al-
gorithm and its types, creating a web application which makes this a task a lot easier
and which could also be used for educational purposes because of its animated algorithm
visualization.
In our accelerating world in a lot of cases we prefer a fast and acceptably optimal
solution, rather than a slow but accurate one. This is where the Ant Colony algorithm
help a lot of industries, which guarantees a pretty good solution in lots of the cases.
The implemented web application helps us in a many areas, because besides the
other functionalities, it implements five types of the Ant Colony algorithm, it is capable
to visualize them, save the input data, show detailed results and store them. With these
tools we can perform measurements on a variety of data sets, with different parameter
configurations and different types of algorithms.
Based on the data acquired from the realized software, I compare the different types
of the Ant Colony algorithm, their advantages and disadvantages in different cases, and
furthermore I search an optimal configuration, which calculates a sufficiently optimal
result within an acceptable run-time.
At last but not least we make conclusion, that in general and for specific input data
sets which algorithm is the most promising, so which one of the many types of the Ant
Colony algorithm is worth further investigation.","Ant Colony algorithm, data, web application.","Ant Colony Algorithm, Web Application, Types, Visualization, Comparison, ",2021
Peter Kristof,Large image collection visualization and browsing,"Abstract
Nowadays, there are many image collection management programs that help the user
to search through their images visualized in different ways.
The aim of my thesis is to develop a software that allows the user to visualize very
large image collections, search between images, create new collections, sort and select
images from these collections according to different criteria.
Thissoftwareiscapableofloadinglargesetsofimages,extractingvariousinformation
from the images, and also storing and managing them. It allows for displaying image
collections in different formats and sorting the images based on previously extracted data,
all through a user-friendly interface. All you need to run it is a medium-level computer
that matches the current technology.
The search in image collections is based on the well-known CBIR (Content based
image retrieval) methods, with the great advantage of being able to extract information
from large image sets without any special intervention.
The extraction of other information from images, in this case metadata, has been
solved by a free and easy-to-use metadata retrieval library. The NoSql local database
provided by MongoDB is responsible for storing this data, with the great advantage of
being able to perform read-write operations quickly.

Bartalis Zoltan Krisztian,SapiFeedback: An online system for anonymous feedback analysis,"Abstract
Theaimofmythesisistoanalyzeanonymousfeedbackstodrawtherightconclusions
in reference to a given topic.
In real life, we often need feedbacks in order to make the right decisions, changes
for the future. Anonymous feedbacks give a more clear picture about the reality, than
not anonymous ones, because it’s in human nature that we don’t give honest feedback
or don’t give feedback at all when its content is negative. For instance, when a teacher
expects feedbacks from his/her students about the quality of the lessons and teaching
methods. In situations like this, it’s really important for people to get realistic feedbacks
in order to learn, improve and make the right conclusions.
In this project a user-friendly and efficient software was implemented which allows to
collect, analyze and visualize anonymous feedbacks. An initial version of this application
has been published at the beginning of this semester to allow for a case study. Therefore,
students applied for the Object-oriented programming course had the opportunity to give
anonymous feedback.
The application allows registered users to create topics for which they request anony-
mous feedbacks. Within a topic, questions can be formulated in order to motivate partic-
ipants for feedback. Feedbacks are collected, analyzed and visualized using word clouds.","anonymous, feedback, natural language processing.","anonymous feedbacks, conclusions, realistic, software, word clouds",2021
Farkas Andrea Szilvia,Data compression using PCA,"Abstract
The aim of my thesis is the usage of principal component analysis for the compres-
sion of digital image files. Moreover, my thesis compares different methods for reaching
the mentioned aim, and experiments with the variation of different constant values for
implementing the ideal compression.
In the world of the modern internet, the storage and sending of different image files
comes with significant storage need and data traffic, and because of that the reduction
of image sizes is essential.
There is more than one method for image compression, in my thesis I am researching
the usage of principal component analysis. Principal component analysis is rooted in
statistics. During the process we are searching so called principal components, which
are specific to the dataset. After the compression, we are storing only the coefficients
of these. The number of principal components can be increased almost arbitrarily, and
with that we can optimize the accuracy, “goodness” of the compressed data, although
that obviously increases the size of the resulting compressed image data files. Since that
goodness value is measurable and comparable, the best method for the compression can
be found relatively easily.
In my thesis I aim to search the answer for the following questions: what kind of
specific characteristics of the images are affecting the goodness of the compression, what
kind of changes are observable between different implementations of the principal com-
ponent analysis, what kind of effects do these have on the goodness of the image, as well
as on the time required for the compression? These results are compared and evaluated.
In my thesis I am searching the answer/answers for the posed questions mainly by
using already existing implementations. The goodness of the resulting images after the
compression is measured by multiple different methods.
Finally, we draw the conclusions based on the acquired results.","principal component analysis, PCA, image compression.","Principal component analysis, Image compression, Data traffic, Storage need, Modern internet, ",2021
Vaida MárkÁdám,Improving Home Security With Artificial Intelligence,"Abstract
The development of technology gives opportunity to improve our everyday tool with
new, useful features. Security systems are not exception. Computer vision gives a chance
to classify objects, persons, body parts or face expressions.
Taking advantage of computers, it is possible to build a system that can make deci-
sions and notify the user. Using this technology, with my colleague, Marton Szilárd, we
have created a security system with artificial intelligence methods which is able to iden-
tify persons from pictures of a security camera and decide based on human movement,
if an action is violent or not. Doing all of this by using built-in face, emotion, voice and
movement recognition.
The system has two parts. The first part is a mobile application which notifies the
user in case of burglary and violence detection. The application gives the user possibility
to customize the system, provides a way to check cameras and notification history.
The second part of the system is a server which can process images and make deci-
sions based on content of an image, doing all of this by using artificial intelligence. The
system can be used as a smart security system as well as for detecting domestic violence.","security, violence, artificial intelligence.","Technology development, Security systems, Computer vision, Artificial intelligence methods, Violent action detection, ",2021
Szabo Henrietta,Pixel sorting,"Abstract
The topic of my paper is to examine and to recreate pixel sorting methods within
an android application. There are a lot of possibilities to edit and to correct our images,
either with difficult image editing programs, or with simple filters, with a click. To get
the glitch effect with the pixel sorting method is not one of the easy methods, generally
you have to dispose of editorial knowledge and even so it is a time-consuming operation,
at present there are few applications, in which it can be applied simply and rapidly. The
glitch effect is such an inexhaustible and creative method, in which randomness plays an
important role. The best part of pixel sorting is that we can achieve different results from
the same method due to the fact that every image is different, so we cannot know what we
achieve until we did not try the method to the given image. In addition, it belongs to such
an area which is developing in our days, too and can be developed also by ourselves, given
that there are a lot of possibilities, and the limits to create these methods are only what
you can imagine. On preparing my paper I designed an application, by means of which we
caneditourimageseasilyandsimply,bythehelpofdifferentglitchfiltersforpixelsorting.
Behind the filters applied on our images, different pixel sorting algorithms make possible
within the application to achieve the desired effect. Each filter is sorting the pixels under
well-defined conditions and criteria, so that the effect should be as aesthetic as possible.
It was a challenge to find such methods which can work quickly also with a higher pixel
number, besides, it was important to experiment with those methods which not only sort,
but also modify the pixels on the image, so that one can achieve a spectacular, aesthetic
and pleasing effect. All these in a creative way by the aid of randomness, all the same
with punctually designed algorithms.","glitch, image, effect.","Pixel sorting  , Glitch effect  , Image editing  , Android application  , Filters, ",2021

Halasz Botond,Recognition of traffic signs using neural network on Android operating system,"Abstract
My thesis is the recognition of traffic signs using neural networks on Android operat-
ing system. Nowadays, more people have their own car and this number is growing more and
more. The problem is that more people ignore the traffic signs that can be found on the road
sections. Drivers with less experience are not intentionally but ignore it, or rather the more
professional drivers are not deliberately paying attention sometimes. This is where my Traffic
Signs app comes in, which is currently specialized in traffic signs.
The app is also useful not only for novice but for more experienced drivers because it is
informative, new different things can be learned from certain traffic signs in the territory of
Romania. In additon, it has a live monitoring feature that monitors the traffic signs in real
time, identifies them, and informs the user.
Careful driving is greatly facilitated by routine and focus, but in the absence of these, a
more modern motor vehicle can be a great help because informs the driver about warnings,
marks and calls on the route in question. The majority of modern vehicles already have a
smart system that informs the vehicle driver about different road factors and dangers. But
not everyone can afford to buy modern cars for financial reasons. So all we have to do is in-
stall the app on a phone with an Android system and a camera, start the app and put it be-
hind the windshield in a position with clear vision for the phone. The purpose of the applica-
tion is to identify the dangers on the road, to notify the traffic signs on the side of the road,
a stop sign that has not been detected can be a big risk at times.
Finally, there are several benefits to this app, which improves the driver’s ability to mon-
itor by constantly informing us about the traffic signs that have been ignored. Making this
driver aware of his own careless. It keeps track of the signs he has ever seen, which we can
show to the police or other driver, as appropriate.","traffic signs, image recognition, neural network","Traffic signs, Neural networks, Android operating system, Recognition, Monitoring, ",2021

Kulcsar Bettina, Mobile application for collecting restaurants and local rese,"Abstract 
The topic of my dissertation is a mobile application that aggregates restaurants and its vacancies 
and we can make reservations with its help. 
Nowadays, we call our smart phone for everything, because it is always at hand and everyone 
wants to perform their tasks quickly and easily. We like to get information quickly and easily. 
Nowadays, even making a booking is not that personal task but a plain phone call can be difficult 
for us. We are looking for a more informative and objective solution and to do so perfection 
solutions for mobile applications. 
Due to the virus situation, pandemic, people could not go to nightclubs and restaurants for a 
long time, so when the relief started, everyone who wanted to take the opportunity and “finally” 
wanted to sit down somewhere for a drink, eat something, etc. Due to the high demand, most of 
the places offering similar services were full house all day, so by the time a person got a free 
table he would probably have had to visit more places in vain. 
The application I wrote tries to eliminate just that. You can conveniently visit restaurants nearby 
without making a phone call in vain (since no one will most likely pick up the phone) or having to 
visit those places in person for a free table. 
As the restrictions seem to disappear more and more, we may think that the application itself is

more to online things. They got used to and loved the simple, few-click solutions, and thanks to 
that, the application would be in demand in the future as well.

Lorincz Csaba,Development of a starter package for MDM applications,"Abstract
The theme of my thesis is Mobile Device Management, and its different implementa-
tion methods, as well as uses. Mobile Device Management is a software made to standard-
ize and simplify the use of mobile devices. The aim of MDM is a client-server architecture
which enhances security, and removes complexities from the user’s tasks. Its most impor-
tant role is enforce different policies, such as banning or restricting different applications
or websites, for which a multitude of different technologies exist.
We can analyze an MDM system by a number of parameters. It is crucial for the
application to be reliable and be well-maintained. It is a priority to run fast and be effi-
cient, so the user will not be bothered during important tasks. One of the most significant
expectation of the users is security and the discreet handling of private data. Last but not
least, it is important for the user to have choices based on personal needs and economic
situation.
The aim of my current thesis is to map the currently most popular MDM options
on the market, compare their capabilities, as well as use the identified data to diagnose
user requirements and expectations. Beyond the market analysis, it is part of the goal to
develop my own starter pack.
The starter pack I develop is a simple and easy to expand basic application, which
can be used as a basis for more robust products. It is made of a simple web API and a
mobile application.
After the presentation of the research and the development, it becomes deducible
which technology, or technologies, are worthwhile to use in the development, or use of
such projects.","Mobile Device Management, market research, starter pack","Mobile Device Management, Security, Policies, User Requirements, Market Analysis, ",2021

Nowadays, more and more people are making purchases over the internet and doing
this from different types of devices, running different operating systems. Therefore, it is
important to design a software that are platform-independent and available from different
devices.
The aim of this thesis is the implementation of a multi-platform advertising system
that helps students and other users to create, share and search between ads. This con-
centrates supply and demand in one place, making it more likely that your ads will reach
your target, making it easier for you to search for ads that fall into different categories.

Izsak Andrea,"""Need a tutor?"": Reservation System","Abstract
Nowadays, traditional, personal reservations have been replaced by reservations on
the phone or on other public sites, be it for beauty salons, doctor’s offices, sports events
or anything else. The purpose of the ""Need a tutor?"" Reservation System application is
to make appointments for individuals as quick and efficient as possible. The project will
implement two-way communication between the two target groups.
One of the target audiences are students who require private lessons, who, within
the framework of the application, will have the opportunity to view the data sheets of
all the teachers they are interested in, as well as see the teachers’ free time. All you need
to do is register, which you can easily do by entering your email address, username and
password.
The other target audience is a group of teachers who give lessons in one subject or
several different ones, and have the opportunity to modify their calendars to suit their
own needs.
The software system has two main components: an application for users running
on Android and IOS platforms and an application server that retrieves data from a
database. The paper contains the ways of operation of the project, the technologies used
for its implementation, the functionality, and a description of the further development

Kőble Melinda Andrea,A comparative study on histogram normalization of MRI records,"Abstract
The main drawback of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents the lack of a
standard intensity scale. All observed numerical values are relative and can only be in-
terpreted together with their context. Before feeding MRI data volumes to supervised
learning segmentation procedures, their histograms need to be registered to each other,
in in other words, they need a so-called normalization. The most popular histogram nor-
malization technique used to assist brain MRI segmentation is the algorithm proposed
by Nyúl et al in 2000, which aligns the histograms of a batch of MRI volumes without
paying attention to possible focal lesions that might distort the histogram. Alternately,
some recent works applied histogram normalization based on a simple linear transform,
and reported achieving slightly better accuracy with them. This thesis proposes to inves-
tigate, which of the commonly used histogram normalization methods provides the most
suitable preprocessed brain MRI data for accurate segmentation via machine learning
techniques, and which parameter settings are likely to assure high quality results. Two
publicly available brain MRI data sets are involved in the investigation, one without and
the other with focal lesions. Based on the results obtained via experimental evaluation,
we recommend using the histogram normalization method of Nyúl et al., with no more
than five milestone that represent constraints of the normalized histogram.","magnetic resonance imaging, brain tumor segmentation, brain tissue seg-mentation, histogram, histogram normalization.","Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Segmentation, Histogram Normalization, Brain MRI, Machine Learning, ",2021
Mozes Botond,Online Signature Verification using Deep Learning,"Abstract
Nowadays, a lot of people use smartphones that make everyday life easier. With
these tools, we can easily manage our subscriptions, bank accounts and other personal
data. Protecting user data is very important. In addition to passwords, patterns, and PIN
codes, biometric methods for data protection are becoming more common.
Biometric methods are harder to copy, so they provide stronger protection for our
data. In addition to the methods used so far (fingerprint, face recognition, voice recog-
nition), signature-based authentication is becoming more and more used. Smartphones
with large displays allow users’ drawing the signatures with their finger.
The aim of my thesis is to investigate online signature-based authentication. I built
a convolutional neural network for feature extraction. I built different models using fea-
tures extracted and processed from the signatures. I studied the accuracy and resource
requirements of these models using the signatures from two publicly available datasets. I
fine-tuned the models for maximum accuracy. The goal was to prevent the system from
accepting fake signatures and rejecting the original user as few times as possible.
To test the models, I created my own Android application, which consists of two
parts. From the signatures entered by the user in the enrollment phase, the system builds
thetemplate/learnsthefeaturesextractedfromthesignature.Aftertheenrollmentphase,
the user has the opportunity to test the models. In the testing phase, the system decides
whether an entered signature is original or fake.","security, biometrics, online signature-verification","Smartphones, Biometric methods, Data protection, Signature-based authentication, Convolutional neural network, ",2021

In my dissertation I will present how a cryptocurrency is built using a blockchain structure, 
and I will talk about cryptographic systems that allow the use of a blockchain. In the presentation 
of my project, we will see step by step how we use cryptography and the blockchain structure

 the case of cryptocurrencies. It will also be about mining cryptocurrencies and the basics.
 I will discuss the dierences and similarities between current cryptocurrencies as well as what 
system is worth using in the current context. Since 2008 in the digital world, more and more 
cryptocurrencies have appeared, where each system has been designed to be as secure
 as possible. Since we are talking about a coin, it is important to use algorithms that are
 as secure as possible, that are resistant to a possible attack and that make the task of
 the attacker as dicult as possible. These are the reasons why the presentation of such
 systems and the description of the necessary theories play an important role in my 
dissertation. We will also see what systems we currently use, how these systems are built,
 and we will also receive an answer as to why we chose these systems. At the end of the 
dissertation, drawing conclusions, I will talk about the long-term plans and opportunities

BlénesiÁron,Sapi3D tour – 3D model       ,"Abstract
The technologies we use in our everyday lives make our lives a lot easier: with a simple mobile
device, we can pay bills or even make a video call while we are on the train. In addition to these, new
demands have emerged, such as getting through the virtual world to places we have never been to.
In this dissertation, we present the creation of a complete 3D model of the main building of the
Sapientia EMTE, which also includes a web UI presented in another dissertation, thus creating a
virtual tour of the university. The developed model is incorporated into the web application as a static
element. The structural structure of the model was based on the real layout plans and architectural
plans of the main building. In contrast to series of photograph based approaches, this method allows
the user to better perceive the spatial location of elements.
The model was created using Blender, an open source modeling software. The developed model
allows us to reach any point, from any angle, thus giving the user the opportunity to navigate freely. At
the same time, we have planned different routes between the most important points of the university,
which help us to get to the secretariat, departments or laboratory rooms, more easily. We also placed a
virtual billboard at certain points in the model. Information about various universities and events can
be displayed on these.","3d model, blender, virtual tour7","Technologies, 3D model, Virtual tour, Navigation, Blender, ",2022
Magyarosi Roland Mihály,PERSONAL ASSISTANT –  DESKTOP APP     ,"Abstract  
Nowadays less and less attention is given to development and modernizing of Desktop 
applications over web and mobile. Although Desktop applications have an important role in the 
lives of users and IT workers. With the quick evolution of mobile phones practically everything 
is possible using the smartphone in our pocket, but it couldn’t and probably will not be able to 
surpass computers for a while.  
The dissertation focuses on a system designed for personal computers or laptops that 
perfectly meets the role of a virtual assistant in our life. The IPA (intelligent personal assistant) 
softwares help the uses perform easy, but frequent tasks like browsing the internet, sending e-
mails and swiftly opening applications while the input is not codes or signals, but simply a 
human voice. Presumably this is the reason for the success of this science that has grown into an 
industry.  
Virtual assistants are the blessing of the 21st century, but their history dates back to 1920. 
Every assistant is different, but their purpose is the same: serving the user. In our case a user is 
person in front of a computer whose job Sapientia Sarah tries to make easier, with performing 
simple, but frequent commands. This technology is accessible on both smartphones, computers 
and recently in household appliances and cars as well.

Bustya Balazs,Implementarea rețelelor neuronale  artificiale prin sinteză de nivel  înalt.   ,"Abstract 
Artificial neural networks have gained great popularity for their accuracy in image processing, 
data mining, classification tasks, and decision-making systems in which previously only humans 
were able to make the right decisions. However, neural networks cannot yet completely replace 
humans, because humans design them depending on the given task. Hardware accelerators are 
used to increase the performance of neural networks. There have been plenty of studies on 
hardware accelerators in recent years. One of the options are FPGA circuits. The main advantages 
of FPGAs used for hardware acceleration are parallelism, low power consumption and flexibility. 
Implementing neural networks on FPGA is a very time consuming and difficult task, that can only 
be performed by experienced professionals. The framework we have developed provides solution 
to this problem. The purpose of the framework is to accelerate and facilitate the implementation 
of neural networks ""running"" on an FPGA, to accelerate neural networks, to study optimization 
options in terms of size and performance, and to automate the programming process. The 
parameterizable neural network models, implemented by the high-level synthesis discussed in the 
dissertation, serve as the basis of the framework, that generates the code of the neural networks 
modelled in C ++ optimized by directives. The Vivado HLS tool generates the IP core of the neural 
network from this code. It automatically integrates into a system built in Vivado. The Vivado tool 
generates the bit file needed to program the FPGA and programs the circuit. The paper includes 
the implementation of a multilayer perceptron neural network and a radial basis function network, 
hardware implementations of nonlinear activation functions, comparison of fixed-point and 
floating-point number representations.","neural networks, FPGA , framework, high-level synthesis, MLP, RBF","Artificial neural networks, Hardware accelerators, FPGA circuits, High level synthesis, Optimization options, ",2022
Kalith Norbert,    Prezență bazată pe telefon ,"Abstract 
  
The theme of my thesis is the design and implementation of a progressive web application to 
help teachers and students manage and track attendance.  
Attendance management is a frequently recurring activity in order to allow instructors to keep 
track of students' attendance in class. Most teachers use traditional methods to record attendance. 
The main drawback of these methods is that they are time-consuming processes. By using digital 
tools, the time spent on this activity can be minimized and attendance recording is more 
transparent for both teachers and students. 
The aim of this thesis was to design and build an application that would facilitate and speed up 
the process of attendance management by taking advantage of the benefits of technology. To 
produce the software, I tested and used a new software development methodology called 
Progressive Web Application. I created a platform-independent application that uses the Web 
NFC API technology to manage presences quickly and reliably, and I also created an Android-
based native application that uses Bluetooth technology in case the user's mobile device is not 
capable of using NFC technology. 
The result was a multi-platform progressive web application and a native application. Both 
software, taking into account the epidemiological situation, provide a contactless presence 
tracking and speed up and facilitate the management and tracking of the presence.","presence management, progressive web application, platform independence, NFCdata transmission","Progressive Web Application, Attendance management, Digital tools, Software development methodology, Contactless presence tracking, ",2022
Dobri Ervinlucrare,UTILIZARE INTERACTIVĂ A  UNEI BANDEROLE EMG  CONTROLAT PRIN GESTURI ÎN  TRATAMENTUL PICIORULUI  PLAT ,"Abstract
Flat foot is one of the most common orthopedic problems, which in the absence of gradual treatment
and correction can also result in serious health problems later on. This unpleasant orthopedic lesion
can be treated efﬁciently with persistent exercise of the foot, with physiotherapy.
Unfortunately, most children are bored with the monotony of physiotherapy, in order to crea-
te consistent perseverance they need the constant supervision, persuasion and encouragement of the
physiotherapist and parents. On the other hand, children love to play, so putting physiotherapy in a
playful framework can make the rehabilitation process easier for everyone and increase its efﬁciency.
In the dissertation I present a self-developed “serious game” framework, with the help of which vi-
deo games can be controlled with the physiotherapy exercises used in the treatment of the ﬂat foot: the
games are controlled by the movement of the foot instead of pressing a key/button. The system detects
the exercises in (near) real time from signals summing up the muscle activity provided by the EMG
(Electromyography) band placed on the child’s leg, and then simulates the keystroke corresponding to
the exercise in the currently running game, thereby controlling it.","serious games, machine learning, neural networks;8","Flat foot, Physiotherapy, Children, Serious game, Rehabilitation, ",2022

The dissertation presents a processor designed and implemented for an FPGA circuit, which I modeled
on the Xilinx PicoBlaze processor. In this paper, I present the steps of design, construction, and testing.
Nowadays, computer technology is developing extremely fast, with redesigning and optimizing
various elements. The processor is one of the most important components of a computer that executes
instructions and controls the entire system.
There are several types of processor architectures, such as Harvard and Neumann architectures. I
built the processor presented in my dissertation on the principles of Harvard architecture. However,
I also used a two-phase piping to make better use of the processor. This allows you to perform
operations much faster.
During the design of the processor, I also took into account the RISC design strategy, the essence
of which is that the processor has a small number and simple instructions. This makes planning easier
and faster.
The aim of the dissertation is to compare the two processors, PicoBlaze and the processor I de-
signed and developed. In terms of computational performance and process control performance. The
tests performed can be divided into two groups, arithmetic tests and analog signal sampling tests.
During arithmetic tests, I examined Factorization and Fibonacci number sequence generation for
both processors. During analog signal sampling, processors had to reproduce sine and square signals
of different frequencies.","FPGA, RISC, Processor emulator, compiler, analog-to-digital conversion7","Processor, FPGA circuit, Xilinx PicoBlaze, Harvard architecture, RISC design strategy, ",2022

back to a specific time limit. In our days the concept of security it becomes more and more 
important in every area of our life, therefore the preservation of this, takes precedence keeping our 
human life. 
     The acceleration of the world, involves the increase of meetings and contacts between 
people and the regular formation of this. An exponential increase of these contacts resulting from 
these meetings becomes a defining motive of our accelerated world. Unfortunately, in some cases 
it creates a negative effect in our lives, it can prevent the opportunity of preserving the security. 
The frequently encounters, the multitude of contacts between people, in some cases can be a threat 
to our heath and the safety of our material assets. 
    During the creation of my license thesis, my goal was the implementation of an application 
which, with the help of Bluetooth technology, can follow where and with whom we meet and 
pursues a certain time limit, which we are spending with a certain person. If it is necessary warns 
the users about a potential contact that could pose a danger of their safety. 
      The application was successfully implemented in the Android development environment, 
with the help of Bluetooth technology integrated in the smartphones. 
     As a result, we get a phone application running on an Android operating system which can 
be used in case of pandemic, or in any case when is required the contact research, but it can also 
be used even for personal reason for the tracking of our own movements and meetings.","contact researcher, Bluetooth, Android, safety","Security, Bluetooth technology, Application, Meetings, Safety, ",2022
Palfi Szabolcs,Price Monitor       ,"Abstract
These days the majority of shopping is done online. There are tons of online shopping websites, with
some kind of big sale going on almost all the time, however these sales are most of the time made up.
These false sales can be spotted only if you follow a products price daily, for a longer period of time
which is a repetitive and time-consuming process. The same can be said when you’re interested in
purchasing some products but you’re not quite decided yet, so you want to wait for the price to drop.
These gave the inspiration for developing our system.
In this paper we’ll present a price monitoring system which automates the process described earli-
er. At predeﬁned moments the system wakes up and scrapes publicly available data from the Internet,
which are than saved. The user has the opportunity to add products to his list, for them to be followed,
and can view the price change on a chart. All this can be done from a Chrome browser extension or
a mobile application built with Flutter. The so-called heart of the system is a python script which is
responsible for the mining of the data, periodically updating the prices and pushing new products into
the database. All this is done while respecting all moral and legal boundaries. All of our data is stored
in a Realtime Database provided by Firebase, which turned out to be perfect for our application.
After months of gathering data, while using the system, we analyzed it and made a few conclu-
sions. We saw multiple patterns emerging from the price changes but there is not one that matches
every product. There were many scams regarding prices, especially during Black Friday but there we-
re also real and signiﬁcant price drops as well. After using the system for a longer period of time we
can say that a software like this helps the buyers in making a purchase decision, by providing useful
data in a easy to read form.","webscraping, browser extension, Flutter app8","Online shopping, Price monitoring system, Data scraping, Python script, Price changes, ",2022
Benedek Szabolcs,   Travel companion finder application ,"Abstract 
The web application built for the exam has been named „The Ride” and the purpose behind 
is to create a well designed and responsive platform for people who want to travel, commute and 
explore. The inspiration behind the idea was the fact that there are a number of Facebook groups 
meant to simplify the search for ride sharing, however, there are not that many individual 
applications built for this purpose. This was the source of inspiration behind my web application.  
An important factor for the project was that it must provide an added value compared to 
similar solutions, for example Blablacar that is currently available in our country. Facebook groups 
are more widespread compared to other ride sharing applications due to the personal aspect of the 
social media platform. Blablacar is an international company whose application is used in multiple 
countries, which is the reason why building a community is more difficult there. „The Ride”, on 
the other hand, is only available for regions in Romania and Hungary, which meant to build a 
stronger, more familiar connection with the local users.  
   My goal for the application was to be able to create the entire route when adding a new 
ride, as well as to provide a breakdown of locations that the ride is passing through. It’s crucial 
that the users are provided with good recommendations for rides. This functionality is built with 
the help of Google Maps APIs which will be discussed further in the exam paper.

with new sensors, making it possible to continuously monitor vital signs. 
The purpose of this diploma work is to develop a system that would benefit from the 
possibilities offered by sensors. The Stroke Monitor application includes two different software, 
which consists of a telephone application and a smartwatch application, their interaction allowing 
the user to monitor their heart rate even outside the hospital. The purpose of monitoring is to inform 
the user and the contact person in case of a possible risk of stroke which is implemented based on 
the data provided by the smartwatch and processed by the telephone application. It plays an 
important role for vulnerable users, because early medical emergency measures reduce the 
aftermath of stroke. The telephone application is also able to display various graphs, determine the 
risk score, provide daily advice to prevent the risk of stroke. During the development of the system, 
we used flutter technology, so the application is platform independent.
